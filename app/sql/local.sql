I&#8217;m your host, Josepha Haden Chomphosy. Here we go.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:00:28] (Intro Music)&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:00:39] <strong>Josepha:</strong>&nbsp;We are back and catching up from our midyear break. And in true WordPress fashion, we&#8217;re just going to start off running. The WordPress Community Summit happened a couple of weeks ago. I&#8217;ve been talking about it on this podcast for a few months now, but if you&#8217;ve missed it and you want a refresher, go ahead and give episode 49 a listen.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At the Community Summit, there were 125 people, if I remember correctly. And we covered a wide array of topics that were brought to us directly from the community itself. While the event is small, it is specifically designed for gathering and sharing information. So, I&#8217;ve got some top-level trends that I noticed that I&#8217;m going to share with you all today, as well as just like a reminder of what happens after a Community Summit.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:01:27] <strong>Josepha:</strong>&nbsp;So there are three, maybe four, big trends that I noticed. The first one that I noticed is that we have a lot of discussions right now about contributor acknowledgment. That also, for what it&#8217;s worth, came with an unresolved question around whether acknowledgment and recognition are the same. I don&#8217;t think they are the same.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But it also was part of a conversation around whether we treat those two things the same. And if they are not the same, should we treat them differently? And et cetera, et cetera, et cetera. For folks who&#8217;ve been around for a bit, you know, that we spent a lot of time working on our contributor recognition a few years back and had really made quite a bit of difference in just reported feelings about how the community felt they were being recognized for their contributions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so a lot of the conversations that we ended up having were around whether or not the project as a whole has changed the way that we provide that recognition or acknowledgment. Or, as an alternative, if the community that is supporting WordPress has changed how they would like to be recognized.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:02:32] <strong>Josepha:</strong> There were also some questions about whether or not making sure that contributors can see their impact. Like they can say, I contributed 10 hours last month, and these are the two things that I got accomplished over there, and that everyone else can see those things too. So, how we can do that more easily while also not having so many metrics and making the metrics so prevalent that we start to close out the people who are truly just doing this for fun.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Like many of the problems that we have at the Community Summit, this is a bunch of pretty much unsolved mysteries at the moment. But it did; it came up across probably five or six different sessions that I heard about, quite a few that I went to myself, and so contributor acknowledgment and recognition is on our minds again.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A second thing that I noticed across multiple sessions, and this one honestly is not a surprise at all, is that there were a lot of questions about what the next big thing is after Gutenberg. I always love when people are asking big questions about what comes next because it means that we all still believe that there will be a next.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:03:43] <strong>Josepha:</strong>&nbsp;And so I never hesitate when I hear these questions to give some ideas about what I think might be coming. But a lot of the discussions that we were having were around, we think this is coming, but now that we think this is coming, what should we do now to make sure that we are ready for it? One of the biggest assumptions that we all had is that for the CMS, for the software itself, probably our next big area after Gutenberg is going to be something about artificial intelligence.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Matt pointed out in his presentation that he has told us twice to learn something deeply. One was in 2016 when he said, learn JavaScript Deeply. And then one was in 2022 when he said to learn AI deeply. And so we all kind of are guessing that that is our future area. And so that&#8217;s an area for everyone to spend some time in. Make sure you understand it. Make sure you know it a bit. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The second thing that came up as like a future, where are we going here? It was kind of on the business-y side. It was on a lot of questions about enterprise and are we selling properly to enterprise. Can we sell, can we appeal to enterprise? Whose job is it to sell any of these things? Questions like that. So, lots of business questions again. This is not something that I have any concerns about. I&#8217;m very excited to see that people are talking about it. That&#8217;s been a topic of conversation since, I want to say, February of this year. And so it also wasn&#8217;t a surprise inclusion today. And, and I was excited to see, am excited to see what we get out of those conversations over time.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:05:17] <strong>Josepha:</strong>&nbsp;As far as like questions around what&#8217;s next for the community, I&#8217;m going to address that separately because it was a huge question for everyone. So I&#8217;m going to discuss that as soon as we get finished with this chunk about like the big thing that, that is coming after Gutenberg.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But, from an ecosystem perspective. Like a WordPress project operations perspective, this came up a couple of times. Never in as clear a word, a set of words as that, but the question about, like, what are we doing with our tools? Are we making sure that we are keeping the tools that our contributors use maintained and still in an excellent space with features that are useful and, necessary, and requested?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so that is a big question. I do have a lot of questions about that. Also, there are so many tools that I have wanted in order to make organizing the WordPress community better and easier, but also making contributing better and easier. And hopefully, here soon, we have an opportunity to get to some of those.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:06:16] <strong>Josepha:</strong> So, the third big trend that I kept seeing at the Community Summit is actually about the community itself, specifically about events. So I was part of or listened to many, many, many conversations over the course of the week that were specifically focused on what we&#8217;re going to do with the future of our events. Like are meetups still sustainable? Are WordCamps still sustainable? And that&#8217;s from not only the idea of sustainability that we all tend to know from like an ecological standpoint but also, you know, checking in on the resources. So the kinds of questions that folks had were, is it time to continue having many small events, or is it time to move to a few giant events?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Should we bring back midsized, WP-adjacent events like PressNomics or LoopConf? And if we are bringing those back, do we want to have them be part of a semi-official thing along with a clearly WordPress event and like do joint sales in there? Try to figure out how to get people from one to the other, so that it&#8217;s not just WordPress people that we&#8217;re talking to, but also business people and advanced developers, things like that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There was also a lot of discussion about whether or not we have gotten too big, should we double down on our grassroots efforts? Just go all the way back to, like, BarCamp style, WordPress in a forest kind of thing.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:07:46] <strong>Josepha:</strong> And yeah, and among all of these conversations, there were questions about the resources that we need. Do we have what we need now? Do we have plans for how to maintain those resources in the future? Do we have enough time? Do we have enough money? Do we have an expertise? The people? So many questions, so many questions. And on the community side of things, we also had a lot of questions that are routine in open source. Like, do we have a pipeline for future maintainers, for future team reps, for future leaders in the project? All of the questions. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, those are the three slash four, depending on how you break it out, really big trends that I saw across the conversation at the Community Summit. And I don&#8217;t necessarily know the answers to all of these things. Like, I know what my gut tells me, I know what I believe the answer to be. From my own perspective, but as you&#8217;ve been told many times with many eyes, all bugs are shallow. And so here is what happens next with a Community Summit. So we&#8217;ve gathered all of these things together. We&#8217;ve had these conversations, and now all of the notes from every conversation that we had will be put on make.wordpress.org/summit.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:09:10] <strong>Josepha:</strong>&nbsp;There, you can do any of the following three things, but at least do one before we get any further. I think it&#8217;s important to remind everyone that no decisions were made at the Community Summit. There are a few things that will come out of the Community Summit where the answer the way forward is really obvious. And so those probably will get done quickly thereafter because it&#8217;s just an obvious thing to do. It makes sense for everyone in the project. It makes sense for everyone who&#8217;s using WordPress. Whatever reason.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So those things will probably move quickly, but mostly not even mostly there were no decisions made. And so if it looks like something is moving quickly there, it is because it makes sense after the fact. So there&#8217;s that. But the three things that you can do in order to take part in this information gathering and sharing that happened at the Community Summit.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Number one, head over to make.wordpress.org/summit and just read the notes. There are a lot of them you can pick and choose based on the teams you contribute to or the topics that are specifically interesting. Or if you have been assigned to read one of these things, obviously, go ahead and read that. But find the notes read them. Take a look at the discussion as far as you can tell it happened and get a sense for what the essential question is.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The second thing that you can do while you&#8217;re there is that you can join in that discussion right there in the comments if you would like to. You can, if you feel like your perspective is not quite accounted for in that, obviously leave some comments and let folks know. But also, if you feel like your perspective was accounted for, but there&#8217;s also a very specific question that was not necessarily answered or not even brought up, share those as well. That&#8217;s stuff that we would like to know as we are working through this.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then the third thing that you can do is you can take those conversations, and if there&#8217;s anything that looks like it&#8217;s particularly relevant to your local WordPress community, absolutely take those there and have those conversations with them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:11:23] <strong>Josepha:</strong>&nbsp;And once you&#8217;ve had those conversations, let us know what you thought also in those comments, or take it directly into your weekly teams&#8217; chat, either way. We want to hear what you think about the questions that were brought because you brought them to us. And so you should have an opportunity to tell us what you think.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:11:39] (Music Interlude)&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:11:48] <strong>Josepha:</strong>&nbsp;That brings us now to our small list of big things. My friends, there&#8217;s nothing but big things left for the rest of the year. And so here we go. Number one, uh, I mentioned it quite a bit. There&#8217;s a conversation, an ongoing conversation about the future of events for our community. Right now, there is an open call for ideas, new features for our NextGen WordPress events, especially on the page that exists on WordCamp Central.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, we want to find the most useful and desirable features for a future homepage on central.wordcamp.org that would host a list of all of our upcoming WordPress events. And so we want your opinion there. Please let us know what would be especially useful to you as you are looking for WordPress events to attend.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The second thing is that we introduced 2024, the default theme that is coming with WordPress 6.4, was announced. We have had, I think, 32 contributors to it at the time of this recording. And yeah, it&#8217;s beautiful. It&#8217;s got a lot of different implementation options, a lot of default patterns, and curated patterns so that you can get exactly what you want out of that theme. I think it&#8217;s going to make a great default theme, a great starter theme for our final release of the year.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then, speaking of 6.4, with the release of 6.3 behind us, we are working hard on bringing 6.4 to the community. You can get involved with the development of that. There is a core chat every Wednesday. It happens. I want to say at 21:00 UTC, but I don&#8217;t actually know off the top of my head. I just go when my calendar tells me to go, and I live in the central time zone. And so, my UTC conversion is not the best, but we will leave the actual information about that in the show notes so that you can see it. But you can also go over to make.wordpress.org, and then there&#8217;s a little card on that homepage that tells you exactly when those core meetings are, including the new contributor meeting, which happens every two weeks. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then the fourth thing is that there is a successful WordCamp US behind us. That is our final flagship event of the year, which is always exciting. If you missed it, for one, we missed you. And for two, we have you covered. We&#8217;ve got a recap of the event. There is a link to that in the show notes as well.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:14:05] <strong>Josepha:</strong> And that, my friends, is your small list of big things. Thanks for tuning in today for the WordPress Briefing. I&#8217;m your host, Josepha Haden Chomphosy, and I&#8217;ll see you again in a couple of weeks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:14:15] (Music Outro)&nbsp;</p>\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:30:\"com-wordpress:feed-additions:1\";a:1:{s:7:\"post-id\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:5:\"15911\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:1;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:60:\"\n		\n		\n		\n		\n		\n				\n		\n		\n\n					\n										\n					\n		\n		\n			\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:4:{s:0:\"\";a:6:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:35:\"WordPress 6.3.1 Maintenance Release\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:71:\"https://wordpress.org/news/2023/08/wordpress-6-3-1-maintenance-release/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Tue, 29 Aug 2023 14:43:11 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:8:\"category\";a:2:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:8:\"Releases\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}i:1;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:14:\"minor-releases\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:35:\"https://wordpress.org/news/?p=15886\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:1:{s:0:\"\";a:1:{s:11:\"isPermaLink\";s:5:\"false\";}}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"WordPress 6.3.1 is available!\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:9:\"Jb Audras\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:40:\"http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/\";a:1:{s:7:\"encoded\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:5097:\"\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">WordPress 6.3.1 is now available!</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>This minor release features&nbsp;<a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/query?status=closed&amp;milestone=6.3.1&amp;group=status&amp;col=id&amp;col=summary&amp;col=owner&amp;col=type&amp;col=priority&amp;col=component&amp;col=version&amp;col=keywords&amp;order=priority\">4 bug fixes in Core</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://github.com/orgs/WordPress/projects/103/\">6 bug fixes for the block editor</a>.

On WordPress as a platform for empowerment and change, Josepha shared, “The more people that know about WordPress, the more people can access the incredible opportunities that WordPress can provide.” And that sustaining the platform for future generations ensures these opportunities will persist. She added, “We exist for as long as people want to use our software.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The community is the key to sustaining WordPress, and Josepha touched on the importance of WordCamps, workshops, and events that create value, promote inclusivity,&nbsp; and spark inspiration. WordPress can be a catalyst for positive change in the life of a contributor, end user, or site builder.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Concluding her keynote, Josepha asked the audience to think about the story they’d want to tell about themselves and their time in WordPress; and the story they would want WordPress to tell the world.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What’s Next for Gutenberg</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<iframe class=\"youtube-player\" width=\"600\" height=\"338\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/EavRd7PtA0Q?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" style=\"border:0;\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation\"></iframe>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Matt began his keynote with a touch of nostalgia, referring to a comment on his personal blog in 2003 by WordPress Co-founder <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/mikelittle/\">Mike Little</a>, and then looked ahead to the most recent release, WordPress 6.3. As this year’s largest release, it includes new features such as the Command Palette, a quick way (⌘+k on Mac or Ctrl+k on Windows) to search your site and access common commands.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://wordpress.org/download/releases/6-3/\"><img decoding=\"async\" fetchpriority=\"high\" width=\"1024\" height=\"535\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2023/08/6.3-Release-Edition-Featured-Image.png?resize=1024%2C535&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"WordPress 6.3 Lionel\" class=\"wp-image-15795\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2023/08/6.3-Release-Edition-Featured-Image.png?resize=1024%2C535&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2023/08/6.3-Release-Edition-Featured-Image.png?resize=300%2C157&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2023/08/6.3-Release-Edition-Featured-Image.png?resize=768%2C401&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2023/08/6.3-Release-Edition-Featured-Image.png?resize=1536%2C802&amp;ssl=1 1536w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2023/08/6.3-Release-Edition-Featured-Image.png?resize=2048%2C1070&amp;ssl=1 2048w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2023/08/6.3-Release-Edition-Featured-Image.png?w=3000&amp;ssl=1 3000w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Matt continued, “WordPress never rests, so right around the corner is <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/6-4/\">WordPress 6.4</a> on Nov 7… with some cool new features.” He shared that 6.4, like 5.6, will be an underrepresented gender-led release. A new default theme, <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2023/08/24/introducing-twenty-twenty-four/\">Twenty Twenty-Four</a>, is tailored for entrepreneurs and small businesses, photographers and artists, and writers and bloggers. Additionally, 6.4 will feature integrated font management and Image block options to expand single images for optimal viewing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Looking further into the future, Matt highlighted Phase 3 of the Gutenberg project, which will focus on workflows and collaboration, “moving WordPress from a single-player to a multi-player tool.” In that spirit of collaboration, a new <a href=\"https://wordpress.slack.com/archives/C05PY7QLR5F\">#LMS</a> working group will also bring WordPress learning management systems together to improve the web standards for courses and learning content.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Beyond Phase 3, Matt shared thoughts about what it means to support WordPress many years from now. A new <a href=\"https://wordpress.com/100-year/\">100-Year Plan</a> from WordPress.com is an exploration into long-term planning for your online presence. He encouraged attendees to be inspired by the region&#8217;s history, reflecting on what it would mean to honor the past while anticipating and planning for the future.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Q&amp;A</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>A Q&amp;A session followed the keynotes, with questions submitted by the in-person audience and live stream viewers.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" class=\"youtube-player\" width=\"600\" height=\"338\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/3Fa0Q-brSeI?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" style=\"border:0;\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation\"></iframe>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Additional questions will be answered in a future post on <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/project/\">make.WordPress.org/project/</a>.

What started with a blog post from co-founder Matt Mullenweg and a subsequent comment by co-founder Mike Little eventually evolved into the world’s most popular web publishing platform.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress software continues to evolve and iterate based on the needs and desires of its robust and diverse user community. This release is the capstone of <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2023/02/04/phase-2-finale/\">Phase 2</a> along the WordPress <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/about/roadmap/\">development roadmap</a>. As the community looks to the future, all efforts turn to <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2023/06/05/wordpress-6-4-development-cycle/\">6.4</a> and, subsequently, the transition into <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2023/03/24/phase-3-collaboration/\">Phase 3</a>, which is expected to introduce powerful collaboration tools to the website creation and management experience.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\" />\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">6.3 Haiku</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>A capstone release<br>Ships tools for building great sites<br>Collaboration</p>\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:30:\"com-wordpress:feed-additions:1\";a:1:{s:7:\"post-id\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:5:\"15718\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:5;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:60:\"\n		\n		\n		\n		\n		\n				\n		\n		\n\n					\n										\n					\n		\n		\n			\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:4:{s:0:\"\";a:6:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:63:\"Concerns over the European Union’s Cyber Resilience Act (CRA)\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:94:\"https://wordpress.org/news/2023/08/concerns-over-the-european-unions-cyber-resilience-act-cra/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 02 Aug 2023 14:25:55 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:8:\"category\";a:2:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:7:\"General\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}i:1;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:3:\"cra\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:35:\"https://wordpress.org/news/?p=15686\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:1:{s:0:\"\";a:1:{s:11:\"isPermaLink\";s:5:\"false\";}}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:216:\"\"Our shared goal is to further bolster the security of digital products without compromising the values of freedom, democracy, and innovation.\" Learn more about the Cyber Resilience Act and its impact on open source.\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:7:\"Josepha\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:40:\"http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/\";a:1:{s:7:\"encoded\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:4334:\"\n<p>As the world’s most popular open source content management system, WordPress acknowledges the European Union&#8217;s initiative to bolster the cybersecurity of digital hardware and software products with the <a href=\"https://www.european-cyber-resilience-act.com/\">Cyber Resilience Act (CRA)</a>. The Act’s effort to counter the increasing threat of cyberattacks and promote informed usage of digital products with increased security updates and transparency is commendable.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\">\n<p>While we wholly endorse the objectives of the CRA, we are apprehensive about the Act&#8217;s implications on open source software due to unclear terms and definitions. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Specifically, the Act’s prohibition on &#8220;unfinished software&#8221; and ambiguous definition of &#8220;commercial activity&#8221; could inadvertently inhibit innovation and economic participation in the European digital landscape.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Open source projects, like WordPress, often rely on continual updates and improvements—a process that may technically fall under the label of &#8220;unfinished.&#8221; Furthermore, the ambiguous definition of &#8220;commercial activity&#8221; could unintentionally encompass open source projects that are largely driven by communities and operate on a not-for-profit basis.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Our letter to the EU Commission</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>We have jointly authored an open letter addressing these concerns alongside fellow open source projects Drupal, Joomla!, and TYPO3<sup data-fn=\"eb28afbc-3487-447f-9af9-8b0418310a00\" class=\"fn\"><a href=\"#eb28afbc-3487-447f-9af9-8b0418310a00\" id=\"eb28afbc-3487-447f-9af9-8b0418310a00-link\">1</a></sup>.

Our shared goal is to further bolster the security of digital products without compromising the values of freedom, democracy, and innovation inherent to both the open source community and the <a href=\"https://european-union.europa.eu/principles-countries-history/principles-and-values/aims-and-values_en\">EU’s Aims and Values</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The letter invites the EU Commission and interested parties to participate in a seminar in Brussels to discuss how we can align the objectives of the CRA with the realities and needs of the FOSS community. We are optimistic that, with mutual understanding and cooperation, we can achieve secure digital products without limiting the vital contributions of open source projects.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-buttons is-content-justification-center is-layout-flex wp-container-9 wp-block-buttons-is-layout-flex\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-button\"><a class=\"wp-block-button__link has-text-align-center wp-element-button\" href=\"https://wordpress.org/news/files/2023/08/Open_Letter_on_the_Significance_of_Free_and_Open_Source_Software_in_the_EU_s_Proposed_Cyber_Resilience_Act.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Read the letter</a></div>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:50px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-group has-off-white-background-color has-background is-layout-flow wp-block-group-is-layout-flow\" style=\"padding-top:var(--wp--preset--spacing--50);padding-right:var(--wp--preset--spacing--50);padding-bottom:var(--wp--preset--spacing--50);padding-left:var(--wp--preset--spacing--50)\"><ol class=\"wp-block-footnotes\"><li id=\"eb28afbc-3487-447f-9af9-8b0418310a00\"><a href=\"https://www.drupal.org/\">Drupal</a>, <a href=\"https://www.joomla.org/\">Joomla!</a>, <a href=\"https://typo3.com/\">TYPO3</a>, and <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/\">WordPress</a> are the most popular FOSS content management systems on the web today.

This is why I am an enthusiast and one who enjoys contributing back to the community via writing, speaking, and helping organize meetups.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When Ihtisham discovered WordPress, his fascination for working with computing grew. He knew he did not want to just work in administration his entire career.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ihitsham describes himself as an ‘introvert’ and therefore the idea of remote work appealed as he could still add value to others through technology. He was intrigued by the thought of the freedom to choose his work hours. However, without access to others who had already transformed their careers and lives through web development, he felt he ‘had no path to follow to turn my dream into a reality.’</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Challenges become opportunities to learn when there is an active community&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"675\" height=\"900\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2023/07/ihtisham-4.jpg?resize=675%2C900&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"Ihtisham Zahoor wearing a sweatshirt with the London tube sign \'Mind the Gap\'.\" class=\"wp-image-15480\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2023/07/ihtisham-4.jpg?w=675&amp;ssl=1 675w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2023/07/ihtisham-4.jpg?resize=225%2C300&amp;ssl=1 225w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 675px) 100vw, 675px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Lacking any kind of informed support network to advise or guide him, Ihtisham devoted time to online research to find the next steps he could take. Looking back, he believes that for those who are not in a network with others with similar interests, it can be hard to keep learning and experimenting with new things. Isolation can be a barrier to working in web development.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He said: “I think it is not easy to stay motivated when there aren’t immediate rewards for the hard work we do. Sometimes, weeks would go by when my only focus would be to stay motivated rather than give up.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>After another two years of combining learning and work, Ihtisham took up using WordPress as a full-time career. He moved to the capital of Pakistan, Islamabad. It was not easy at first. He recalls: “After many failed attempts at getting hired and desperate moments, I finally received an offer from a digital agency as a web developer focused on the WordPress platform.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He added: “Moving to work with a bigger agency was one of the best decisions of my life as it helped me with my professional growth by becoming familiar with the whole WordPress ecosystem in a supportive environment. I was valued for my opinions in the web projects in which I was involved. I was also appreciated and encouraged for the open source work I did for the company.” He summarized his enthusiasm for WordPress like this: “It is really interesting figuring out what is happening in the backends. I like problem-solving and finding solutions which you can do with WordPress.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>During the Covid-19 pandemic, Ihtisham moved to join a start-up which provides web development services to international clients. He works as a developer and has the opportunity to learn more about client communication and project management. “WordPress has opened up so many opportunities for me. It has been an exciting journey for me with lots of learning every day,” he said. In particular, he has discovered an interest in APIs and regularly uses his spare time to follow tickets in the hope of one day contributing even more to topics.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Give back through WordPress community</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"800\" height=\"599\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2023/07/ihtisham-1.jpeg?resize=800%2C599&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"Ihtisham Zahoor speaking at a meetup.\" class=\"wp-image-15477\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2023/07/ihtisham-1.jpeg?w=800&amp;ssl=1 800w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2023/07/ihtisham-1.jpeg?resize=300%2C225&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2023/07/ihtisham-1.jpeg?resize=768%2C575&amp;ssl=1 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>It was not just software that made a difference in Ihtisham’s life. Joining a welcoming and sharing community was transforming for him. Recalling those early days of isolation, he values the WordPress community and is wholly committed to the power of open-source software. He now enjoys writing, speaking, and organizing meetups to give back to the community. He has been involved in developing plugins and themes for the platform, which he describes as a ‘humbling’ experience. He is fond of <a href=\"https://islamabad.wordcamp.org/\">WordCamp Islamabad</a> and in 2023 is on the organizing team to help bring both WordPress and its community to others in Pakistan.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“My first experience,” he said, “was that everyone was so friendly and open to sharing what they have learned, even though they were all busy working. This really had an impact on me. It really helped me and gave me the confidence that I could work with WordPress…. It was a real step forward for me joining this community.” </p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"512\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2023/07/ihtisham-WC-Karachi.jpg?resize=1024%2C512&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"Ihtisham visited WordCamp Karachi.\" class=\"wp-image-15482\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2023/07/ihtisham-WC-Karachi.jpg?resize=1024%2C512&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2023/07/ihtisham-WC-Karachi.jpg?resize=300%2C150&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2023/07/ihtisham-WC-Karachi.jpg?resize=768%2C384&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2023/07/ihtisham-WC-Karachi.jpg?w=1200&amp;ssl=1 1200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>A particular meeting in 2018 led to new friendships through the WordPress community. Ihtisham was on a train to Karachi for the first ever Pakistani WordCamp in 2018 and met a group of fellow attendees he now regards as close friends. What impressed him most about the camp was that although he met many people with considerable expertise, they also had a generosity of spirit and humbleness in their willingness to share this knowledge. Now, with this group of friends he is fulfilling another dream of traveling widely across the country. He says these things and other ‘side benefits’ have been made possible by the WordPress community, and for that, he is &#8216;forever grateful&#8217;.<br><br>Ihtisham particularly wanted to share his story through this People of WordPress article to encourage those starting with little or no support to remain persistent. He knows from experience breaking into the tech world can be hard, especially when you may be switching from doing something else and have no ‘track record’ to offer. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>He feels he is a living example of how perseverance can lead to success. He offers these words to anyone thinking of making a move into development using the WordPress platform: “I attribute my success (financial and mental well-being) to the open-source nature of WordPress and its amazing community. It would not be possible to learn and use the plethora of free tools WordPress provides if it weren’t an open-source platform. It is for that reason I feel obligated to contribute back to this platform to the best of my abilities.” To those who are finding getting going difficult, as he did, he adds: “Get yourself a clear learning path and just dive in doing WordPress, and things will get better for you over time as they were for me, I promise. Good Luck!”</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Share the stories</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Help share these stories of open source contributors and continue to grow the community.&nbsp;Meet more WordPressers in the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/news/category/newsletter/interviews/\">People of WordPress series</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To help you discover more about how to use the WordPress software, there is a free resource from the community, <a href=\"https://learn.wordpress.org/\">Learn.WordPress.org</a></p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Contributors</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Thanks to Ihtisham Zahoor (<a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/shaampk1/\">@shaampk1</a>) for sharing about his adventures in WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Thank you to Abha Thakor (<a href=\"//profiles.wordpress.org/webcommsat/\">@webcommsat</a>), Nalini Thakor (<a href=\"//profiles.wordpress.org/nalininonstopnewsuk/\">@nalininonstopnewsuk</a>), and Meher Bala (<a href=\"//profiles.wordpress.org/meher/\">@meher</a>) for interviews, the feature and collaborating on images.

Need to repeat the same contact information across your site and keep it up to date? Create a synced pattern with all the details, and say goodbye to repeating yourself, with the ability to quickly insert the synced pattern wherever you need it. If you find yourself creating various banners for your site and want them to have the same layout with unique content, creating an unsynced pattern speeds up your workflow and ensures a level of consistency in approach. While themes and plugins have been able to offer patterns to users and <a href=\"https://developer.wordpress.org/block-editor/how-to-guides/curating-the-editor-experience/#utilizing-patterns\">curate the experience</a>, this update allows agencies and site builders to do the same for their clients, directly in the site building process.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Dig into the details</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Any previously made Reusable blocks will continue to function as they do now, just under the new Synced pattern name. To help adjust to these changes, a few contextual notices will be placed throughout the interface. Specifically, the menu item in the creation flow will show as “Create pattern/reusable block” until the prompt describing the switch is dismissed in one of the various locations, including the naming and syncing modal:&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" class=\"youtube-player\" width=\"600\" height=\"338\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/fbrhammtn3Y?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" style=\"border:0;\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation\"></iframe>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>For folks using block themes, all patterns will be listed alongside template parts in the Site Editor &gt; Patterns section, where you can enter a focused editing mode to make changes.

In this case, many of these plugin authors have included zero contact information in their extensions or are not responding to communication attempts. Patchstack has characterized it as a &#8220;<a href=\"https://patchstack.com/articles/the-wordpress-zombie-plugins-pandemic-affects-1-6-million-websites/\">zombie plugins pandemic</a>&#8221; due to the overwhelming number of abandoned plugins affecting more than 1.6 million sites.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The WordPress.org Plugins Team has acted on the report by closing more than 70% of the plugins. In June, the team <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/wordpress-plugin-review-team-adds-6-new-sponsored-volunteers-opens-applications\">added six new sponsored volunteers</a> and opened applications for more team members but have <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/wordpress-plugin-review-team-addresses-backlog-of-900-plugins-implements-strategies-to-improve-approval-process\">struggled with managing a formidable backlog</a> of plugins waiting to be reviews.

This is his 10th round of capturing performance data from hosting companies that opt into the testing. Ohashi&#8217;s <a href=\"https://wphostingbenchmarks.com/methodology/\">methodology</a> tests two metrics through a variety of methods: peak performance and consistency. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The benchmarks include a LoadStorm test designed to simulate real users visiting the site, logging in, and browsing (uncached performance). They also test cached performance, SSL, WP queries per second, performance on some computational and database operations, and a WebPageTest that fully loads the homepage and records how long it takes from 12 different locations around the world. As part of the consistency testing, Ohashi also measures uptime using <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://hetrixtools.com/uptime-monitor/166399.html\" target=\"_blank\">HetrixTools</a> and <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://uptimerobot.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Uptime Robot</a> for a minimum of three months.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Participants pay a standard, publicly documented fee, based on the price tier of the product being tested, to cover the costs. Ohashi does not accept sponsorships for the tests, and has become one of the most trusted sources for unbiased performance reviews of WordPress hosting plans.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In 2023, Ohashi tested 31 companies across 72 plans and seven pricing tiers, with tests nearly identical to previous years. He made minimal adjustments to the LoadStorm test script to improve performance and make it compatible with newer versions of k6.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The website makes it easy to review results at a glance by using a star system. Hosts that achieve &#8220;Top Tier&#8221; status receive a full star:</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\">\n<p>This is awarded to companies who maintain 99.9% uptime throughout the entire testing and show little to no performance degradation during load testing, primarily focused on error rate and consistent response times. Error rates above 0.1% and response times above 1000ms* will keep a company away from achieving Top Tier marks.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>The half star indicates &#8220;Honorable Mention&#8221; status, which is given to companies that came close to Top Tier but fell just short, such as struggling slightly on a load test.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Among budget hosts in the <a href=\"https://wphostingbenchmarks.com/benchmark/2023-25-wordpress/\">&lt;$25/month category</a>, the majority of hosts (16/21) rang in at the Top Tier level. Those who did not earn Top Tier status were held back by inferior performance on the the LoadStorm test for the most part, even though several still took top scores in other aspects of the testing. </p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<img width=\"1222\" height=\"1194\" src=\"https://149611589.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Screen-Shot-2023-09-01-at-11.58.44-AM.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-148428\" />\n\n\n\n<p>There are fewer participants at the $25-50 plan (and other more expensive plans) but the results are similar to the budget hosts, with A2 Hosting, Cloudways, and Stromonic edged out of contention for Top Tier. All three failed to achieve Top Tier for any of the plans tested this year. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the <a href=\"https://wphostingbenchmarks.com/benchmark/2023-enterprise-wordpress/\">Enterprise tier ($500+)</a>, the majority of participants handled the LoadStorm test without issue. When testing cached performance, Ohashi found that the overall field of participants is getting faster: </p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\">\n<p>Excluding Seravo, every company was 33ms average or below and 43ms p95 or below. Compared to last year where the fastest average was 6.4 ms and p95 was 20ms. There are four companies this year below both of those levels. The performance at the Enterprise tier is mind bogglingly fast and getting even faster which is hard to comprehend when last year&#8217;s 6.4ms was beaten by 4 plans this year.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<img width=\"2094\" height=\"1304\" src=\"https://149611589.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Screen-Shot-2023-09-01-at-1.13.36-PM.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-148433\" />\n\n\n\n<p>Most of the entrants in the <a href=\"https://wphostingbenchmarks.com/benchmark/2023-woocommerce/\">WooCommerce category</a> earned Top Tier status, with the exception of Blallo and Cloudways, both of which stumbled on the LoadStorm test. The hosting plans tested range from $25.95/month &#8211; $99/month. The WooCommerce-specific tests collect average response times, total requests, errors, and other metrics across four different profiles:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Profile 1 (20%): Buyer – Homepage, add item to cart, go to cart, checkout (doesn’t submit order)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Profile 2 (10%): Customer (existing) – Homepage, login, view orders, view account details</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Profile 3 (20%): Browser – Homepage, visit 5 random product pages</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Profile 4 (50%): Home – Homepage only</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>A more detailed breakdown is available on the WooCommerce benchmarks results page.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<img width=\"2350\" height=\"1208\" src=\"https://149611589.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Screen-Shot-2023-09-01-at-2.56.46-PM.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-148441\" />\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s important to note that the tests do not clearly identify a winner or top performer. They also don&#8217;t take into account other aspects of the WordPress hosting experience, like reviews, support, and features. Ohashi tests the defaults for all of these plans, but if there are more optimization features that can be customized for sites (which are not clearly outlined in the initial setup) then those are also not taken into account. The methodology simply focuses on performance, so it&#8217;s just one factor of hosting, albeit a very important one.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;As far as surprising results, I keep thinking &#8216;Are we nearing the point that we won&#8217;t see much improvement?&#8217; and each year the whole field gets faster and faster,&#8221; Ohashi said. &#8220;Even improving on sub 10ms times between years. For example, in the &lt;$25/month tier, in 2022 there were 3 companies with &lt;50ms average response time on the Static k6 test. This year there are 10. I also saw 100ms+ improvements from the other (slower) side bringing up the whole field a meaningful amount. Everyone is getting faster and faster.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Why Are Some Managed WordPress Hosting Companies Missing?</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>There are many leading WordPress managed hosts that are notably absent from Ohashi&#8217;s benchmarks, whose inclusion would be helpful for a deeper understanding of market. I asked him about a handful of them and he reported that WP Engine, Dreamhost, and Kinsta declined to participate this year, to name a few. GoDaddy took a year off but may be back next year.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The major reasons for hosts not wanting to participate fall into a few categories, and bad performance is chief among them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Some companies perform poorly or poorly relative to price and don&#8217;t want to participate anymore,&#8221; Ohashi said. &#8220;They usually talk about other &#8216;intangible&#8217; values that you can&#8217;t measure. I think good performance should be a default for every hosting company, and good companies shouldn&#8217;t be afraid of bad results &#8211; if they actually plan on improving their services. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;But some would probably rather spend fortunes on marketing instead of better engineering, and bad results aren&#8217;t going to help their marketing. I personally love seeing companies who participate year after year despite mixed results. I respect the companies who consistently earn Top Tier are doing a great job. But there&#8217;s something special about companies willing to put themselves out there regardless of the results, because it&#8217;s a public and open commitment to improving.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ohashi said that occasionally the timing doesn&#8217;t work out where a host is going through a major engineering overhaul during the testing and doesn&#8217;t want the platform benchmarked when they are about to release a new one. In this case some opt to skip a year. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The costs of the benchmarking can also be prohibitive for some smaller hosting companies. Ohashi raised prices by $250 across all tiers this year (eg. $100->$350, $500->$750) to cover his costs. Although this doesn&#8217;t seem like much for a hosting company, they also have to pay for the servers for four months, and have the staff/resources available to work with Ohashi on organizing, executing, and debugging issues. 20i, Krystal Hosting, Nexcess, and Pressable agreed to sponsor upstart companies in the space for 2023.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Another reason some hosts don&#8217;t participate is a lack of interest or value. They don&#8217;t see how they can use the benchmark results to their advantage.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Some companies don&#8217;t get as much value from the benchmarks as others,&#8221; Ohashi said. &#8220;Performance across the board has gone way up. It&#8217;s harder and harder to stand out. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;I think some companies may view it as an instant validation and reason for customers to come busting down the doors. But there are a lot of great companies offering great performance. Earning Top Tier status means you&#8217;ve got a performant hosting platform. It&#8217;s great, and it can help validate some customer needs/desires in the decision making funnel, but it won&#8217;t magically generate tons of sales.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ohashi said he has put together notes for hosting companies that earned Top Tier status to help them leverage more value this year from a marketing perspective, based on what he has seen some companies do with their results. Creating more value for participating companies is something he is actively working to improve upon.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Although Review Signal had approximately 35,000 people visit in the past year, Ohashi doesn&#8217;t think the traffic captures the full value of the benchmarks very well. The people who dig into these metrics are those who have a large impact on where their WordPress clients host their websites.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;The people who care about the benchmarks are seriously into WordPress / hosting / performance,&#8221; Ohashi said. &#8220;It&#8217;s a lot of agencies, developers, large website owners and hosting people. One way I&#8217;ve measured impact is by going to the major WordCamps (EU/Asia/US) and talking to people. The number of folks who are aware of the benchmarks there was surprisingly high to me. The people who are interested enough to spend time at WordCamps are the same folks interested in reading the benchmarks. It&#8217;s not the largest number of people who read them, but it is the largest impact people who read and value them.&#8221;</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Fri, 01 Sep 2023 21:17:38 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:5;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:55:\"Do The Woo Community: WooBits Hits the Air Waves, Again\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:28:\"https://dothewoo.io/?p=76231\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:53:\"https://dothewoo.io/woobits-hits-the-air-waves-again/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:341:\"<p>WooBits takes another twist and turn and introducing Global Community Friends.</p>\n<p>&gt;&gt;

It incorporates some of the proposed solutions and speeds up translations by converting <code>.mo</code> files to <code>.php</code> files, allowing them to be parsed faster and stored in <a href=\"https://www.php.net/manual/en/book.opcache.php\">OPcache</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It supports multiple file formats (<code>.mo</code>, <code>.php</code>, and <code>.json</code>) and multiple text domains and locales loaded at the same time. Existing <code>.mo</code> files get converted to <code>.php</code> files which are then loaded by WordPress.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>A chart included on the plugin&#8217;s details page shows a significant page load time reduction when using the plugin, as compared to sites with translations that don&#8217;t use the plugin. The plugin brings translations very close to the same page load times as English (non-translated) sites.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<img width=\"1658\" height=\"1200\" src=\"https://149611589.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/performant-translations.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-148367\" />\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;With enough testing and feedback, we hope to eventually merge this plugin into WordPress core,&#8221; Performance Team contributor Pascal Birchler said when announcing the plugin on X.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;In the coming weeks and months we will share more testing instructions and continue to improve the plugin. This will be made available via Performance Lab, too.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Users who are testing the plugin can <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/performant-translations/#new-topic-0\">report issues on the support forum</a> or create an issue on the <a href=\"https://github.com/swissspidy/performant-translations\">GitHub repository</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Performant Translations is considered to be a beta testing plugin but can be tested and used in production at your own risk. It doesn&#8217;t require any changes to settings or configuration after installation. The plugin can be safely removed after testing, because it essentially cleans up after itself. All <code>.php</code> files it generates will be removed by the server once the plugin is deactivated and uninstalled. </p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 30 Aug 2023 01:39:18 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:8;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:84:\"WPTavern: Top Agencies Join Forces to Publish Free Guide on WordPress for Enterprise\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:30:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=148240\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:95:\"https://wptavern.com/top-agencies-join-forces-to-publish-free-guide-on-wordpress-for-enterprise\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:2611:\"<p>A collection of leading WordPress agencies have launched a collaborative project to promote the platform to large-scale organizations.  Big Bite, in partnership with 10up, Alley, Human Made, Inpsyde, and XWP, have published a free <a href=\"https://bigbite.net/wordpress-for-enterprise/\">WordPress for Enterprise guide</a> that includes contributions from Google and WordPress VIP.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The guide highlights many high profile companies and organizations using WordPress, including CNN, Vogue, Google, The Wall Street Journal, Spotify, Harvard University, the White House, Meta, PlayStation, and many more.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Even after 20 years of unprecedented growth and adoption across major brands, the misconception that WordPress is just a blogging platform persists among many who don&#8217;t keep up to date with open source software.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Despite being the number one CMS, many people still associate WordPress solely with bloggers and small businesses, and are surprised to learn that it powers sites for some of the biggest brands on the planet,&#8221; Big Bite CEO Iain McPherson said. &#8220;By coming together to create this guide, we’re aiming to change that perception and highlight the many advantages it offers to enterprise organizations that have lots of contributors, lots of content, and lots of challenges.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The guide offers an easy-to-read overview of how well-suited WordPress is for the enterprise market and the possibilities for creating a customized platform to fit any organization. It includes short chapters on the following topics:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>From small blogs to big brands </li>\n\n\n\n<li>Open source advantages </li>\n\n\n\n<li>Platform security&nbsp;</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Scalability and internationalization</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Solution cost and value&nbsp;</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Editorial experience&nbsp;</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Performance matters </li>\n\n\n\n<li>Feature extensibility</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Headless capabilities</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>“While smaller brands are able to switch CMS platforms fairly easily, for large-scale enterprises it’s often a major undertaking, so we hope this guide makes the decision process much easier for those exploring open source options,&#8221; WordPress VIP Director of Product Marketing Michael Khalili said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The guide is a useful resource for large organizations examining WordPress as a platform or for small agencies looking to pitch WordPress to larger clients.

It includes managed WordPress hosting (whatever that looks like in 100 years), multiple backups across geographically distributed data centers, submission to the Internet Archive if the site is public, 24/7 dedicated support, and a domain that doesn&#8217;t need to be renewed by the customer for a century.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>ICANN, the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers, limits domain registration to a maximum of 10 years. Auto-renewing after this time requires the customer to renew on time and keep their payment method updated. A 100-year plan removes these uncertainties but still hinges on the registrar staying in business into the next century.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Customers who buy into the plan will need to have superior confidence in WordPress.com, coupled with the belief that domain names will still be important to the fundamental architecture of the web decades from now.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Automattic CEO Matt Mullenweg commented on the difficulties in pricing the 100-year plan during his presentation at WordCamp US 2023, while simultaneously discouraging WordPress product owners from offering lifetime licenses. The distinction here is that the 100-year plan has a finite length of time, even if its future support seems unfathomable at the moment. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;It also got me thinking about lifetime licenses, which I think we should stop doing in the WordPress world,&#8221; Mullenweg said. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;If you&#8217;ve ever worked with an accountant or an acquirer they don&#8217;t like when you have those because it&#8217;s essentially an open ended commitment, including often with support. How do you recognize that revenue? Offer a 20 year plan or something. I think when you&#8217;re saying &#8216;lifetime,&#8217; it sort of cheapens the word. If we&#8217;re really thinking long-term, what promises we&#8217;re making to our customers, I think we should re-examine those practices.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mullenweg also said he was inspired by the <a href=\"https://longnow.org/\">Long Now Foundation</a>, a non-profit established to foster long term thinking. The organization&#8217;s first project is the &#8220;Clock of the Long Now,&#8221; a mechanical monument designed to keep accurate time for the next 10,000 years:</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\">\n<p>It is still being assembled deep inside a mountain in west Texas. The Clock provides a rare invitation to think and engineer at the timescale of civilization. It offers an enduring symbol of our personal connection to the distant future.</p>\n<cite><a href=\"https://longnow.org/\">The Long Now website</a></cite></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress.com is building something parallel to this in the digital world, enabling people to create their own virtual, lasting monuments and preserve their homes on the web. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Embedded in the new offering is also a poignant reminder that WordPress.com is a domain registrar, as the company recently <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/wordpress-com-makes-a-bid-for-google-domains-customers-offering-1-million-free-transfers\">made a bid to capture Google Domain customers</a> ahead of their domains being sold off to Squarespace. Even if the new 100-year hosting plan is too expensive for 99.9% of prospective customers, it gives the impression that the company is capable of hosting entrusted domains for the long term. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Nobody, not even WordPress.com, knows what that will look like in 50 years, but it&#8217;s an ambitious, thought-provoking offering. What resources will a URL (Uniform Resource Locator) point to 50 years from now? Or will URLs be discarded into the scrap pile of obsolete building blocks as soon as there&#8217;s a better, more efficient way to identify web addresses? What does longevity look like in the digital world?</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Tue, 29 Aug 2023 04:25:16 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:11;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:81:\"WPTavern: Video: WordPress Leaders Discuss Project’s Future at WordCamp US 2023\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:30:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=148270\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:88:\"https://wptavern.com/video-wordpress-leaders-discuss-projects-future-at-wordcamp-us-2023\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:3006:\"<p>WordCamp US concluded this weekend after gathering nearly 2,000 attendees in National Harbor, Maryland, for the Community Summit, Contributor Day, and main conference days. For the majority of people in the WordPress world who were unable to attend, the recordings of the presentations from project leadership will give you an idea of what to expect in the near future and beyond. These videos were <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/news/2023/08/the-future-of-wordpress-whats-next-for-gutenberg/\">published</a> right away and are embedded below.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress Executive Director Josepha Haden Chomposy spoke on &#8220;The Future of WordPress,&#8221; with an emphasis on how the project can continue to thrive, build resilience, and outlast its current contributors. She encouraged the community to be proactive about expanding their learning and connections. She also reaffirmed the importance of the project&#8217;s mission to democratize publishing and the impact that can have in the world.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n\n</div>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress co-creator Matt Mullenweg capped off the event with a presentation titled &#8220;What&#8217;s Next for Gutenberg,&#8221; followed by a Q&amp;A. He highlighted a few features coming in 6.4, including font management, an image lightbox, and the new Twenty Twenty Four default theme.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As WordPress is moving into the Collaboration phase of the Gutenberg project, which will enable multiple authors to edit simultaneously, Mullenweg highlighted the importance of redesigning the admin. This will be the first major redesign since MP6 and is also aimed at improving workflows for administrators.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mullenweg announced that WordPress has launched a new LMS (Learning Management System) working group. He commented on the benefits and drawbacks of having multiple plugins in the ecosystem that do the same thing. Although the competition can encourage more innovation, it can also lock users into one solution if they aren&#8217;t built to be interoperable. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Representatives from Tutor LMS, Learndash, LifterLMS, and Sensei met to discuss using common data models so users can easily switch between solutions. They are working in a new #LMS slack channel to establish industry standards that will preserve user freedom and choice through practical interoperability changes to their products.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mullenweg also said he would like to see more plugins, such as those handling SEO or site builders, to agree on some data models so that products can operate in a more standardized and performant way, serving users better in the long term.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Check out the presentation below, along with the Q&amp;A that followed. There were more than 80 questions submitted, and those that were missed during Q&amp;A will have answers published to in a future post on WordPress.org.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n\n</div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n\n</div>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Mon, 28 Aug 2023 22:15:14 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:12;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:87:\"Gutenberg Times: Gutenberg Changelog #88 – WordPress 6.4 and Gutenberg 16.4 and 16.5.\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:53:\"https://gutenbergtimes.com/?post_type=podcast&p=25373\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:91:\"https://gutenbergtimes.com/podcast/gutenberg-changelog-88-wordpress-6-4-and-gutenberg-16-5/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:83824:\"<p>Ellen Bauer and Birgit Pauli-Haack discuss WordPress 6.4 and Gutenberg 16.4 and 16.5 and proposed wp-admin changes. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://gutenbergtimes.com/podcast/gutenberg-changelog-88-wordpress-6-4-and-gutenberg-16-5#shownotes\">Show Notes</a> / <a href=\"https://gutenbergtimes.com/podcast/gutenberg-changelog-88-wordpress-6-4-and-gutenberg-16-5#transcript\">Transcript</a></p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Music:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/xirclebox\">Homer Gaines</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li>Editor:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/sandy-reed/\">Sandy Reed</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li>Logo:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://markuraine.com/\">Mark Uraine</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li>Production:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://icodeforapurpose.com\">Birgit Pauli-Haack</a></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-larger-font-size\" id=\"shownotes\"><strong>Show Notes</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Ellen Bauer</strong>, co-founder Elma Studio</h3>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>WordPress <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/elmastudio/\">@elmastudio</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li>Twitter/X <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ellenbauer\">@ellenbauer</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://www.elmastudio.de/en/\">Elma Studio</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://ainoblocks.io/\">Aino Blocks</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/elmastudio/#content-themes\">Themes by Elmastudio </a></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">WordPress 6.4 and more</h2>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2023/08/22/roadmap-to-6-4/\">Roadmap 6.4</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2023/06/05/wordpress-6-4-development-cycle/\">WordPress 6.4 Development Cycle</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2023/08/24/introducing-twenty-twenty-four/\">Introducing Twenty Twenty-Four</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li>&nbsp;<a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2023/08/23/whats-new-for-navigation-in-wordpress-6-2-and-6-3/\">What’s new for Navigation in WordPress 6.2 and 6.3</a>&nbsp;</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Gutenberg </h2>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2023/08/10/whats-new-in-gutenberg-16-4-9-august/\">What’s new in Gutenberg 16.4?

In today&#8217;s episode, we will talk about the releases of WordPress 6.3 and 6.4, Gutenberg 16.3 and 16.4, and I&#8217;m your host, Birgit Pauli-Haack, curator at the Gutenberg Times and full-time core contributor for the WordPress Open Source project on the Automattic Five for the Future Program. And it&#8217;s a great pleasure for me to have with me today, Ellen Bauer. She&#8217;s a theme developer and 6.4 co-design lead on the release board. She&#8217;s also a co-founder of Elma Studio, a theme development shop and AinoBlocks is one of their products. Ellen has been a very early adopter of blocks and block themes and provided a ton of feedback to the core team. Thank you for joining me today, Ellen. Good evening to New Zealand. How are you?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Ellen Bauer</em>: Thank you very much, Birgit. I&#8217;m very good. Yeah, I&#8217;m just excited to be here. And actually, coming on here has helped me a lot to catch up with all the things that are happening and it&#8217;s so exciting to see it all coming together. Yeah, I&#8217;m just really, really excited for 6.4 and to be part of it and all the things that are coming to WordPress. It&#8217;s really, really cool.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Excellent, excellent. So how is AinoBlocks doing? Do you have a theme and separate blocks for it?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Ellen Bauer</em>: So yeah, yeah, we do have blocks like block collection or single blocks. It was mainly we started that AinoBlocks to experiment with building blocks and bring blocks into our workflow and to make things happen that weren&#8217;t possible for a long time with just the default blocks. That&#8217;s just how it started, just to build the designs out that we wanted. And we still love to use a lot of the blocks there, especially we have an advanced grid block and things like that. We need to catch up on the spacing and things like that that came into default.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m planning to do that within the next one or two months to have a bigger update because what we&#8217;ve also been doing is building more block themes, coming back to our roots and back to themes because yeah, it&#8217;s now possible to build block themes and bring the two worlds together and just designing. We missed that with all just block building, we missed doing cool designs, but we didn&#8217;t want to build classic themes, too. So yeah, we were on hold for a long time. And now, we are really, really excited to get back into designing and we have a few cool new designs in the works and it&#8217;s just a lot of fun now to bring the worlds together and really create advanced and modern designs at WordPress. It&#8217;s really cool.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah, I&#8217;m looking forward to your new designs and what you and Manu will come up with. So for our listeners, the last Changelog was a little bit was about four weeks ago, and a lot has happened in those four weeks. We will not cover it all and we hope you can catch up on the other news outlets on those 6.3 came out and 6.3.1, the release candidate was just released this week, will come out next week. We are recording this on August 25th, 2023, and 6.3.1 is scheduled to come out on August 29th. So for those who are binge listening to this at a later date, if you haven&#8217;t upgraded yet, do that now. 6.3.1 is coming out with some bug fixes for some of the features that surface quite late in the release cycle.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Announcements &#8211; WordPress 6.3 and 6.4</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Speaking of 6.3 or WordPress release, the roadmap for 6.4 was also just published this week.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s a tight release cycle with the first beta scheduled just four weeks from now, September 26 I think, and this makes it an ambitious list of features and updates. The release is set to be scheduled for November 7th, so there&#8217;s always the two months between beta or six weeks. No, it&#8217;s only five weeks, six weeks, five weeks between beta one and final release. So this one is quite special because the release was, is all about underrepresented gender people that lead the release in all release categories. And you are on design team, Ellen, I&#8217;m on the editor triage team with Anne McCarthy together, each of the release teams of two or three people deep. So what is the design team going to do in this release?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Ellen Bauer</em>: So yeah, I&#8217;m just starting to get really into the work and kindly, Anne has, we have created a side channel in the Slack community for the design team and Estella did actually take the initiative on that. And kindly, Anne has posted and put together a list of tickets and things we are going to get into and some more people shared tickets and issues there. And then of course, the about page and yeah, we&#8217;re just getting started on that. It&#8217;s really exciting, I&#8217;m excited to be on the design team again and it&#8217;s really cool. Tammie Lister also is helping out and Rich put together a to-do list in the beginning, which was cool because last time, I joined for 5.6. Also for the underrepresented gender release, I was struggling at some points like what I&#8217;m supposed to do and when.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So yeah, this is way more organized now and yeah, it&#8217;s really cool to do it a second time and have a group of people who have also done it before and let&#8217;s just know more what is happening. And I&#8217;m really excited about the new default theme, too. That&#8217;s really cool that this is going to be added for 6.4 because we also had a new default theme released with 5.6 back then. I can&#8217;t believe it&#8217;s already two or three, I think last podcast, you said it&#8217;s three years ago. I was like, what? It&#8217;s crazy, but I guess it is. Yeah, so that&#8217;s really exciting and-</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah. So the default theme leads are Jessica Lyschik and Maggie Cabrera.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Ellen Bauer</em>: Maggie. Yep.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: And they just introduced the designs for the theme on a separate post and we will certainly share that in the show notes as well, as well with the roadmap, but that&#8217;s only one thing on the roadmap. The others are that there are two new features coming in. Well, at least one of them is the font library.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Ellen Bauer:</em> Yes. So excited for that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah, that independent from themes, you can now have fonts on your site and manage them, or that&#8217;s the goal for it. So you&#8217;re not tied to a theme with the font, how your site looks and how your text is displayed independent from the theme. And there will be the backend is already working for that. That comes in in Gutenberg 16.5, so that is one of them. And Anne McCarthy&#8217;s post, she also had some designs already added to it, some pictures of it. Another part is the revisions for the styles were new in 16.3, but there were no revisions for templates and template parts and those will come with 16.4 there on the list.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We will have new blocks where a table of contents block has been long time in experimental, but it&#8217;s slated now to be released into core. There&#8217;s still a discussion about the time to read block because there is some, well, if you say okay, you have 30 minutes to read, that&#8217;s a normal, it normalizes how the reading capabilities, but if you are dyslexic or in other ways have accessibility issues, it&#8217;s ableism to give you how long you can read about this, that you&#8217;re not normal.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And that is definitely a discussion to have if we want to have that in core. So the discussion is ongoing. Another block would be the scrolling key block, which it comes out of the &#8217;90s and will never leave us scrolling.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Ellen Bauer</em>: Yeah, I actually felt, I mean, we&#8217;ve seen that a lot in designs being trendy, but I was also surprised to see that as a core block in discussion. I mean, it&#8217;s cool that we don&#8217;t have to have custom solutions, but yeah, I&#8217;m most excited about the table of contents block. I remember last year, I was about to like, okay, should I have a custom block? Should I do that? And then I read, okay, it&#8217;s being done. So it&#8217;s cool to finally see that being added. Can&#8217;t wait for it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah. And I was playing around with it or testing it, playing around equals testing and I always found it in the previous versions limiting because if I have a table of contents, I want to style it, I want to have some maybe different fonts, maybe different backgrounds, maybe different titles, a control over which heading goes in or out. I&#8217;m not sure that all my expectations will come in. So there is definitely room for a custom table of contents block, but I really don&#8217;t like when a table of contents that&#8217;s only 10 or 15 items long that has all the numbers and the indenting numbers in addition, that&#8217;s not additional information, any distracts, is this a priority or not. So I wasn&#8217;t really able to make it a bullet list, but I think that those things will be fixed definitely.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Then there&#8217;s also the image lightbox or each image block will have a feature that you can, with light box, zoom in on it or have a larger version on it on your screen. If you click on the image, that has been experimental in the Gutenberg for a while. I&#8217;m very excited about the order insert blocks because that is a piece that has been missing for since the beginning. I think that you can add something to a block that is not in the interface, like what would it be?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So the example is a like button to add it to a comment, or another heading link or maybe just a citation or anything that you can put in dynamically that the user doesn&#8217;t have to control it. So I was thinking sometimes for the click to tweet, can we do this on a block? And it doesn&#8217;t have to be in a separate block, you can just put it in a paragraph or in a heading, or have an additional anchor on a heading without having to do a table of contents to get them automatically built. All these, they&#8217;re all different. I&#8217;m sure there are a lot of use cases for that, too, but I&#8217;m really excited that that is coming to the editor.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Ellen Bauer</em>: Yeah, I think so too. It&#8217;s, like you said, been missing for forever, just like you said, a like button or tweet button that yeah, it just makes it more attractive and easy to use blocks if you have these things auto inserted. Yeah, you don&#8217;t want to tweak around with these little items. I think that&#8217;s pretty cool. And I was surprised about the next one, the post formats. That&#8217;s pretty cool to come back to these ones. We have an old theme that&#8217;s like a post format Tumblr-style theme and it&#8217;s been ongoing popular with post formats, so it&#8217;s cool. We can maybe do a block version redesign for that theme, that would be amazing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah, and post formats weren&#8217;t really tended to in the block editor at all.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Ellen Bauer</em>: Yeah, not at all.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: So bringing that in, it&#8217;s definitely there has been some feedback that this is missing and some theme developers actually didn&#8217;t switch because it wasn&#8217;t available. So that is a good thing for adaptability, but it&#8217;s also with all the insecurities around the social networks and the fragmentation of it that many content creators are thinking about maybe building their own and just giving them post formats. And one of them is actually the non-title post that you just like a tweet, you get just 280 characters and put it in a post and you don&#8217;t need a title for it, and you have it on your website and then you can share it via an ActivityPub process with any of the social networks that you wanted to do. And you don&#8217;t have to go out and go directly to the social networks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Ellen Bauer</em>: I always love that so much and I&#8217;m already excited to actually build a theme for these kind of purposes. And yeah, like you said, with Twitter not being there anymore, it&#8217;s sad. I feel for the first time actually really excited to start blogging again, and I think it will do that, just like a private blog because I don&#8217;t feel there&#8217;s the right home anymore on any social platform. And yeah, I really miss something and I&#8217;m really excited to use WordPress as not only for business websites and things like that, but actually for blogging again, which is funny and cool to come back to that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Ellen Bauer</em>: I haven&#8217;t felt the urge to just blog for such a long time and now, I want to blog again. So yeah, that&#8217;s really exciting to see that. And I&#8217;m already seeing some new block themes come out of that project as well, which is pretty cool and creative.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: And it&#8217;s certainly for writers and blogging, but it&#8217;s also for if you cherish Instagram just to share one photo and be done with it from your mobile phone and now you could do this with your own website, I think it would be just as well, but people who are interested in would follow your blog and your pictures on the blog. And if it has a nice theme that highlights that similar to Instagram or something like that, then and people can follow with a Jetpack or wordpress.com account, they can follow any blog they want. And I know that the ActivityPub plugin is now sponsored by Automattic and so we can create WordPress so it can actually push things into those social networks and even people following on the social networks, but you don&#8217;t have to create on those social networks, you are in control of your own posts and pages and pictures. And so I&#8217;m really, I think this is the most important thing for the web, for the independent web in the future.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Ellen Bauer</em>: I think so, too. I think so, too.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: So I&#8217;m really, really great.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Ellen Bauer</em>: Yeah. Seeing what can happen to these network, it just doesn&#8217;t feel right to just post your&#8230; Yeah, I feel exactly the same. I was like yeah, even Instagram, it doesn&#8217;t really feel good to post your content there. I was like, &#8220;I want to do it on my own website and still share there&#8221;, but yeah, I think yeah, we really make these experiences now and it&#8217;s cool. Yeah, it&#8217;s really exciting.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: All right, yeah. And then also 6.4, the writing experience will have a focus on that. So the content creation flow on the writing part, like the distraction-free writing, list items, quotes and navigation items, getting additional capture toolbars and all this nice things. Then interfaces and tools like list view, top toolbars, command palette, they&#8217;re all getting additional enhancements or expansions. Site editing will get definitely additional UX polish and quality of life and also additional features.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Ellen Bauer</em>: I love the list view.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Oh yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Ellen Bauer</em>: It&#8217;s my favorite thing. So having the group locks, custom naming is like yeah, I mean, we have been asking for that for quite a while and it&#8217;s coming up. And now having that, it will be so cool.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah, yeah, and then this…</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Ellen Bauer</em>: I mean for designing, the list view is just&#8230; We need to be in control.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Right, right, right. And if it&#8217;s just a group, group, group group, you don&#8217;t know where you are.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Ellen Bauer</em>: Yeah, it&#8217;s awful and it will be cool. And for page patterns, having them like the sections ready with naming and stuff to get out to your customers and theme users, that will be just improving the whole experience because at the moment, it doesn&#8217;t look great, but I still love to use the list view.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah, yeah. And yeah, there will be an expansion on the box shadow component, which is in the Gutenberg plugin. It&#8217;s also I think for one or two blocks available, but now it will be available for more blocks, of course. And then custom CSS enhancements are coming, more support for elements for individual blocks, and all these little but important things will get a refinement and enhancements. The same for the global styles, the style book especially, which is such a great help in previewing themes in designing, seeing how the style variations change your sites and all that.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Ellen Bauer</em>: I love that, too.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah, that&#8217;s actually one of the big features in 6.2 and 6.3. 6.2 only was a little bit hidden in the global styles, but it brought forefront in 6.3 for the site editor in the site editor so you can directly access it. And another focus for 6.4 is the pattern, realm of patterns like the ability to set categories to update the inserter experience to improve the compatibility with non-block themes, which is still an issue. And another idea might not work with 6.4, but there&#8217;s definitely a stretch goal there to have partially synced patterns. Right now, we have either sync patterns or unsynced patterns, but sometimes you want to have update the style of a pattern and that replicate through previous posts or pages, but not the content. So you couldn&#8217;t do that right now, but there&#8217;s an effort to do that. Depending on how the testing goes and how easy it is to work with, it might make it into 6.4, it might not make it, but that is still&#8230; So there&#8217;s quite more navigation creation and management. Now that there&#8217;s the base is done, there&#8217;s some additional…</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Ellen Bauer</em>: It&#8217;s like never ending. It&#8217;s so cool.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: No ending, no.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Ellen Bauer</em>: I saw the poster, I was like, &#8220;What is happening? This is so cool.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Ellen Bauer</em>: I mean, it&#8217;s a lot of work. We will see how much we can get into with not a lot of time, but it&#8217;s exciting. I mean, at one point, these things will get added to the core, so very exciting to see that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah. So when you go, dear listeners, to look at that roadmap post that will be linked in the show notes, you&#8217;ll also see links to the current GitHub issue or PR that is in the works about the certain items and you can then gauge how far it is along, how long it is, and also chime in and help with the testing. That would be really good. Another way of it is we will have a separate, there is a separate project board for 6.4 with quite a few items on it. More will be added to it of course, from this and from some of the tracking issues, and there you can follow along on the progress of in the next five weeks until we get to Beta 1. So all new enhancements, new things need to be in the release that are supposed to be in the release by Beta 1.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Then it’s new feature freeze. And then after that, there&#8217;s only bug fixing in the beta cycle to release candidate one. There&#8217;s even possible to do some bug fixing afterwards, but then there&#8217;s also release candidate one string-free. So if there&#8217;s anything, user interfaces or something like that won&#8217;t get into the release after that because the translators are working on the translation of the new release. And so yes, it&#8217;s a long list for such a short turnaround time, but well, we don&#8217;t know where the boundaries are until we get to them. So we will report of course on the progress on things. We mentioned already the introducing of 2024, we will share the link in the show notes as well. What do you think?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Ellen Bauer</em>: So I read the post that was posted yesterday by Jessica and maybe I think what we didn&#8217;t mention yet is so Maggie and Jessica are leading the theme development, but Beatriz actually did the design work for it. And yeah, I checked out the Figma file today this morning and I think it&#8217;s really, really amazing. I&#8217;m really excited. It seems like a lot of work, but I think a lot of people are already helping out with creating patterns and stuff. I hope maybe I have the chance to do one or two patterns as well if I find the time, or style variations I think is a topic that people can help out with creating and contributing like we did with the last default theme. But yeah, I think it&#8217;s beautiful, it&#8217;s very sophisticated, and I like that they&#8217;re working on different user cases. So I think there&#8217;s a blogger writer category and business, small business portfolio type or small business and yeah, and portfolio.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think the three are the main topics they want to cover with that theme and yeah, it looks beautiful. It makes me really excited and I think it fits to WordPress and the new WordPress we see. It&#8217;s really, really beautiful, I love it. And I think yeah, it&#8217;s really exciting to see all the patterns and page templates and all the things you can do because the last team had style variations, but not a lot of a layout building included so that&#8217;s going to be exciting. And that, combined with the free font library and the options there, really, really cool to see that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah. I think we&#8217;re getting to a place where when you install WordPress for the first time and you use the default theme out of the box there that you have a headstart on getting your website finished just with the tools that come from the default theme. So there are two things that are not possible now, but that they&#8217;re working on for the 2024 that is that you can have templates, more than one template for a homepage. Right now, you can only have one. Well, the front page and yeah. And then if you create another one, it overrides that and it doesn&#8217;t give you a choice.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So that&#8217;s one thing, that would cover all the three use cases that you mentioned. And the other part is to actually also provide designs for the various post formats. And when you look into the post, there is one section there that shows you, or in the Figma file, there&#8217;s one section there that shows you just a mason gallery how the posts are, the different post formats are displayed. And I think that&#8217;s what you mentioned with your older theme, Ellen, that it&#8217;s still very attractive for people and I&#8217;m glad that we might have that out of the box.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Ellen Bauer</em>: Yeah, it&#8217;s really, really exciting. Yeah, and you can do so much with this theme. And I think, yeah, we never had that before, that default theme was really that flexible and people can really&#8230; Very usable, it looks very usable for the first time. I&#8217;m really, really excited. And the design is I think really fits to what WordPress has to offer. I think it&#8217;s a really great work, very exciting.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: And I&#8217;m looking forward to also seeing the page patterns. So when you create a new page that you can have a series of right now, you have to assemble the page yourself with various different patterns that might fit together or not. And with the page patterns, you have a single page fully created and you just need to change your content, the pictures and the content, but that it already gives you a blueprint for single pages, be it a service page or be it an about page or even the homepage. So I think that gives any user a head start with a new site or with an existing site that decides to have that theme.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Ellen Bauer</em>: So true. And yeah, I remember really advocating for&#8230; We need page templates, page patterns, whatever we call it, but ready-to-go pages pre-designed for users to choose and have multiple options. We can imagine three or five about pages and they can choose because yeah, putting the patterns together is for, like a lot of users, still like a daunting idea and it&#8217;s overwhelming and why not provide it? We have patterns, we can do that. And yeah, we&#8217;ve also been doing that with our themes quite a lot and I think it&#8217;s really, really attractive to have that come together.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah. I have to say that, yeah, you have the feedback loop directly with your customers, so I&#8217;m glad that WordPress is on the right track there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Ellen Bauer</em>: Yeah, I think so because patterns just in general, it&#8217;s still, I mean, people getting more used to it but it&#8217;s really hard to understand for a lot of people, like what is that? It&#8217;s just a section? I want a page, and providing ready-to-go pages is just so much easier. It&#8217;s really, really cool to see that and have more themes, have that available. Maybe even, I remember saying that last year, even already discussing that, that we have next to a pattern library, like pattern directory, have a page pattern or maybe even there&#8217;s a new word that needs to be created for these patterns. Maybe not, maybe they can live in the pattern preview but they could be too long maybe for preview, I don&#8217;t know. But you have a library for that to theme independent available. I think that&#8217;s really, would be really attractive.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah, and that&#8217;s I think where the pattern category work comes in where you can categorize those patterns and also the browsing the previews. So if you have a bigger screen, you get a two-column preview of patterns that are under a certain category so you get a thumbnail view, how they&#8217;re big, and that works nicely, but those underpinnings had to first be built. Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Ellen Bauer</em>: Yep. Yeah, yeah, yeah. It really comes together and I love what I see, yeah. It&#8217;s so funny that things, like I said last year, it felt like so much struggle to get people excited about block themes and site editing and now it&#8217;s coming together. I think with a little bit more practice, users will really just love it and forget about what we had before. It&#8217;s really cool.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah. Well, it also comes in handy that the navigation block editor has gotten a lot of improvements in 6.2 and 6.3.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Ellen Bauer</em>: So true.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Community Contribution</h3>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah. And Dave Smith, a core Gutenberg contributor, posted an update on it so you can read up about it, how it&#8217;s going to work, but because to be honest, I personally struggled after the first year trying to make navigation work beyond a simple navigation with pages to add a site logo to it or to add a search bar to it or something like that. It was definitely a struggle and it was not thought through, and I wanted to have multiple menus and now, that all came together in 6.3 with the site editor where you have multiple places where you can tap into the navigation and make adjustments, be it providing navigation places and just switch out the menu for that, that was not possible. Before, you had to remove the navigation block and add it again and then yeah, it was yeah, the…</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Ellen Bauer</em>: Yeah, yeah, it was the biggest blocker I think for users to get into, they&#8217;re like, &#8220;It&#8217;s not working&#8221;. And yeah, like you said, very simple sites and then it ended. Yeah, very, very exciting to see that. I think now, yeah, just with that, people can really start building entire websites, block themes and stuff, it&#8217;s really tremendous work. And I can imagine it was difficult to get that right, or it&#8217;s still an ongoing process. But yeah, I&#8217;m really happy to see that, too.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah, and that is, we&#8217;re just, it&#8217;s all I wanted to point out from hosts, from the themes and then now, we get into what is actually happening in the Gutenberg plugin.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Gutenberg 16.3 and 16.4</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>So Gutenberg 16.4 was released on August 9th, so right after 6.3 was released, and certain items from the Gutenberg 6.4 release actually made it into 6.3. There were actually quite a few, I think 20 to 25 items. I have not identified them, but you will see it in the PR if you follow through the Changelog and click on one of the PRs and you want to know, it had a back port to WordPress release candidate labor that was added and then once it was back ported removed, you see that in the history of the PR. So Sarah Norris was the lead manager for the release manager for 16.4 and she wrote that it introduces exciting new features, including both a new experimental feature and a new component, and we will talk about what those are alongside many enhancement and bug fixes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bug fix highlights include many improvements to the recently added footnotes block and enhancements to patterns. The footnotes block, most of the bug fixes actually made it into 6.3 major release, WordPress release and some of the enhancement for patterns, too. Those were the two areas where there were last minute bug fixes that made it into the release. There were in total 184 pull requests authored by 60 contributors, including two new contributors, and the release has a list of all of them.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Features</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the features that she mentioned, the new component was a basic progress bar component and in the release note, she also, Sarah also has some notes to that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And it&#8217;s a horizontal progress bar component that can be used in various places and it replaces the spinner component for the site editor loading experience. Of course, these are public components that can also be used in third party or custom blocks or custom plugins, so there was that. It also gets some design tools with it as well. And it can be tested in the Storybook, which is other, it&#8217;s a different thing than the Style Book. The Storybook is for developers and on the WordPress GitHub repo, you can see the Storybook of all the components with all the attributes and you can test around just in isolation and then grab the code and add it to your own code base.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Ellen Bauer</em>: Yeah, I&#8217;ve just looked at that the other day with the progress bar and yeah, I think it&#8217;s definitely an improvement. And I&#8217;ve actually just opened the Storybook for the first time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Oh, really?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Ellen Bauer</em>: It&#8217;s pretty cool to have.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Ellen Bauer</em>: Yeah. I&#8217;ve never seen that. But I used lots of these items for our blocks before, but I&#8217;ve never seen that. That&#8217;s great to know. It&#8217;s new to me.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah, I think we need to…</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Ellen Bauer</em>: Was it? Yeah, no.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: It has been there since a long time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Ellen Bauer</em>: I think it&#8217;s a long time, yeah. Maybe I have been there, I forgot about it. Maybe I have seen it, but pretty cool.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: If you click on the introduction, it says how the site works and the resources to learn more. And also, it has the code that you can add. It shows you different variables on things, attributes and how they look, so and so, and it also has, there is a section there for components experimental. If you go there, just be aware that it might, and progress bar is one of them, just it might change slightly of the course of development. We definitely need to promote that more that people can go through the Storybook and test some of the components and see how they work, what the documentation is about.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Enhancements</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>So the next item on the Changelog is that now the keyboard shortcut for the command palette is now visible in the side view, it&#8217;s command K or control K, but I never remember keyboard shortcuts, so I&#8217;m glad that it&#8217;s now displayed in the header section of the site editor and so you can know it, too.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Ellen Bauer</em>: I actually love shortcuts, but I also tend to forget them. So that&#8217;s handy because there are some cool ones and you can really speed up your workflow, especially if you&#8217;re really designing in WordPress, so that&#8217;s really cool. Yeah, I love to have the shortcut. Okay.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah, I think you would really love to use the command palette for these quick steps things because you don&#8217;t have to click through all the menus to get there. So the command palette is a open page or add page and then you get a … or open page and then you get a list of the pages that are on the site and then you can select them without going to out of the site editor into the pages or from wherever you are and go to pages and then go down the menu items. So I really like the command palette, and that will definitely speed up content creation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Ellen Bauer</em>: Oh, true. Yeah, it&#8217;s really powerful.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: What also comes with enhancement on the site editor, there are quite a few, but I&#8217;m only pointing out to that one. The pattern library, it switches to a three-column layout on use screen, so that is definitely&#8230;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Ellen Bauer</em>: I love that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: That fills it all up. Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Ellen Bauer</em>: Yes, I love that because we are building a lot of patterns and I was always like, can we just preview more?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah, yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Ellen Bauer</em>: One thing I noticed with the pattern, like the explore all patterns view, I feel weird and I wonder if it&#8217;s just temporary or so because the two-column layout is like a light gray background because most of the patterns are most likely with a white background, in most themes at least. And then explore all patterns is a white background and it doesn&#8217;t look great. Have you noticed that? And I wonder, is that an error or is it just…</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: I think it would be something to make an issue out of on GitHub, but what you are referring to is the inserter.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Ellen Bauer</em>: Yeah, yeah, yeah, that&#8217;s true.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: And the switch to three-column layout on your screen, that&#8217;s on the site editor.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Ellen Bauer</em>: In the site editor, okay, I get it. I get it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: In the patterns section of the site editor where you have the menu on the left-hand side.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Ellen Bauer</em>: Okay, okay. Yeah, of course, where on the site editor. Oh, yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: In the site editor, yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Ellen Bauer</em>: But yeah, in the site editor, I have the dark background as I can see here.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Ellen Bauer</em>: Yeah. Okay, that makes sense. I have to test that out again.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah, but it&#8217;s definitely worth I think creating an issue for the inserter to maybe also recognize some of the dark light contrast there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Ellen Bauer</em>: Yeah. I haven&#8217;t checked if there&#8217;s an issue and it&#8217;s also not consistent, why I have this light gray and then switch to white? Yeah, I will check it out if there maybe is an issue already or what&#8217;s going on there because yeah, it doesn&#8217;t really make sense.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Ellen Bauer</em>: And I tested a few themes just to see if it was me, if I had it, but they all had the same issue. Maybe it&#8217;s temporary.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: And it might be even a good way to say that the browse all patterns goes to the site editor if it&#8217;s a block theme. With the classic theme, that wouldn&#8217;t work, but yeah. But to have that, that would go site editor. Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Ellen Bauer</em>: That makes sense, yeah. So true. Yeah, I mean, we just want to stay in the site there because it looks so nice and polished. That is true. It would be cool. I will test that out, maybe I can create an issue.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: I&#8217;m just making a note there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Ellen Bauer</em>: So now, we go into the post editing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah, we are now here at the post editor. There are new commands available now to show or hide the block breadcrumbs. That&#8217;s I think on the bottom of things to get into switching off settings. So enable pre-published checklist or disable the pre-published checklist or change into, or just make a preview in the new tab. Those new commands for the power users there to switch off, on and off the settings so you don&#8217;t have to go through the menu items to go to the options bar and then change the settings for certain things. Even if you just want to toggle on and off and not have it permanently done, changed for your session.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Ellen Bauer</em>: I love all the fine-tuning we are now at. It&#8217;s incredible to see that. Oh my god, all these little things happening that do make a difference, it&#8217;s so cool.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah. Speaking of, there&#8217;s the footnotes received in 16.4, add link background and text color support. So now, you can not only create the footnotes and they take on any styling from the theme, but now you can as a user also change the text color background and all that for your footnotes. That&#8217;s actually a very interesting new block, I really love it and I&#8217;m glad that it&#8217;s now in core to test it further on various use cases.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Ellen Bauer</em>: So true.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: And then also, the…</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Ellen Bauer</em>: And then you have the pre-formatted.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Ellen Bauer</em>: Get spacing support.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah. In 16.4, there were more additional enhancements to the blocks performance, you got the spacing support you said, yeah. And then in the words block, you can have now and even the line breaks so you can, instead of paragraph, you also can have line breaks there. Social links get the threads icon so you can have in your list of social profiles that you point people to also go to the new Threads environment of Facebook.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Ellen Bauer</em>: That is good to have. I&#8217;ve yet to check out Threads. I mean, it&#8217;s good to have it. I think especially that since we don&#8217;t have Twitter anymore really, I&#8217;m excited. I want to try it. Have you tried it yet?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: No, and I&#8217;m also hesitant. It&#8217;s not rolled out to all Instagram users. So you need to have an Instagram account and what I saw…</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Ellen Bauer</em>: Yeah, that&#8217;s true.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: &#8230; on certain platforms when people tried it was if you wanted to delete it again, you actually needed to delete your Instagram account…</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Ellen Bauer</em>: Oh, wow.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: &#8230; and I wouldn&#8217;t want to go there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Ellen Bauer</em>: That&#8217;s not nice. Oh yeah, that&#8217;s not nice.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: So I wouldn&#8217;t going to go there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Ellen Bauer</em>: That&#8217;s true.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Well, but on the other hand, yeah, maybe I should delete my Instagram account already.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Ellen Bauer</em>: You can delete everything. Yeah, I mean, we don&#8217;t need more social platforms to be honest, I feel. But I&#8217;m always keen to check something new out.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah, we do. Me, too.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Ellen Bauer</em>: It looks nice, it looks nice and simple and while you&#8217;re already at Instagram, but yeah, I think it&#8217;s weird that it&#8217;s connected with Instagram because I know how they&#8230; Maybe.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: I didn&#8217;t get it offered yet, so maybe because I&#8217;m not on Facebook, I&#8217;m only on Instagram, so I don&#8217;t know.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Ellen Bauer</em>: Oh well, was it that maybe or could it be that this had something to do with European Union holding back with it? I think I have no clue. I didn&#8217;t follow it, but I think Manu mentioned something like that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yes. Yes, you&#8217;re right.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Ellen Bauer</em>: So I think that&#8217;s it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: It&#8217;s only for US Americans and not for EU people. So that&#8217;s another reason.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Ellen Bauer</em>: Yeah. New Zealand somehow, we got lucky. We can use it, but I just didn&#8217;t have time yet.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Ellen Bauer</em>: Yeah. I think that&#8217;s the problem, which is actually good that they&#8230; But yeah, I don&#8217;t know where that will go, but it&#8217;s good to have the icon at least.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Yeah. Yeah, so true. Yeah. I just started being on Bluesky, I just got my invite so I just set it up. So I&#8217;m wondering if there&#8217;s actually a Bluesky icon already, so we&#8217;ll see. If not, I&#8217;m going to create an issue about it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Ellen Bauer</em>: Yeah. Historically, I think I remember WordPress being always super late to add icons, so it&#8217;s cool that they&#8217;re faster now.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah. So next thing on our list is that unsync patterns didn&#8217;t come into the quick inserter. So if you started slash and started typing, you didn&#8217;t get a selection of your patterns. That is now&#8230; You can now do that. You find your patterns in there if you use the quick inserter. So that is&#8230; Also, if you search for it, you find them in the quick inserter. So I think that&#8217;s a really good enhancement. I was always wondering why I needed to go to the big blue button to get to my patterns.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Ellen Bauer</em>: That&#8217;s another big improvement with the sync patterns, unsync.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Definitely quality of life improvement. Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Ellen Bauer</em>: It&#8217;s so helpful for a user.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah, absolutely. So we are almost at the end of what I wanted to point out as enhancements. Go and read the post release. I wanted to point out also that with this release, the plugin minimum supported PHP version is 7.0. I don&#8217;t think that anybody who uses a Gutenberg plugin is actually on 5.6, but just so if you are, now is the time and you want to be in touch with all the future releases, make sure that you upgrade your site to at least a 7.x version of PHP. That coincides with the WordPress 6.3 release that also bumps the minimum supported PHP version for WordPress to a 7.x PHP version. So 6.3 is the first version that does not support 5.6 anymore, PHP 5.5 versions, 5.x versions.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Bug Fixes</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>In the bug fixes, I found a few things that I wanted to point out because there were bugs that we had to deal with and we don&#8217;t, or maybe not.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So the cover block ContrastChecker, or the ContrastChecker that is in the sidebar to give a hint when your contrast between the foreground and the background color was not accessible or not high enough to be accessible, that algorithm didn&#8217;t work well with the cover block because of the combination between text, image, alpha overlay color and all that, that was way too much for the algorithm. So they disabled it for the cover block. They didn&#8217;t disable it for the InnerBlocks. So if you have InnerBlock a paragraph and you change the background color there and the text color of that doesn&#8217;t match, it still works. But for the cover block itself, it&#8217;s disabled because it had too many false positives and it was just the algorithm doesn&#8217;t go far enough. And then it&#8217;s better to not have it than having false positives in there. There&#8217;s, in the release in the PR, there&#8217;s also some discussion in there on why the team came to that decision.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Ellen Bauer</em>: It could be that it&#8217;s maybe temporary or…</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah, I don&#8217;t know if there&#8217;s a focus on improving the ContrastChecker because that was an external tool, but it&#8217;s definitely just the nature of the cover block just has too many variables in there. So the image block finally got a fix on the image sides for the all wide and full width alignments. Sometimes that wouldn&#8217;t fill it all up or grab the wrong size, so this is now fixed. It has multiple variations there and it&#8217;s definitely a better feel for the image block when you add alignments there. And then the last one is that the video block got a fix for the styling. For the vertical alignment of the video, there was always a little gap on top of it. That was hard coded and they removed it. So if you fix it locally on your own theme or in your own site, you might need to look at it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Ellen Bauer</em>: I think I saw that. Oh, I have to check that out. I haven&#8217;t used the video block quite often, but I mean, it is handy. I have to test it. I think I saw that once that it has this gap. I remember, I think.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah. Any spacing is now with the space. So from the beginning, the spacer block was one of the most used blocks amongst the top five most used blocks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Ellen Bauer</em>: Oh my god, I never liked it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah, but it helps. So made it easy for content creators to…</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Ellen Bauer</em>: That is true.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: &#8230; just adjust things, yeah. And now with dimensions controls, with padding and margin, it still is probably easier to use than figuring out, okay, what is padding and what is margin again? Is it inside or outside or what? Yeah, but it&#8217;s not that necessary anymore, especially when you have patterns and theme templates that actually took care and all of them put together. Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Ellen Bauer</em>: I&#8217;m not sure, but the problem was also that it was fixed, like a hundred pixels stayed a hundred pixels. Is it still like that? I don&#8217;t even know why.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: The spacer block? No, no.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Ellen Bauer</em>: Yeah, the spacer block.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: It can say four, four pixels, 15 pixels, 150 pixels. Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Ellen Bauer</em>: No, I mean, does it responsive? The spacing, is it like fluid?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Is it fluid? I&#8217;m not quite sure. That&#8217;s a good question. I think it is.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Ellen Bauer</em>: Because that was the main reason why I never used it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Because it wasn&#8217;t fluid, yeah. Yeah, I think it is.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Ellen Bauer</em>: I haven&#8217;t checked that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: &#8230; it&#8217;s definitely a good question.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Ellen Bauer</em>: Maybe we can&#8230; Now, we have spacing way better.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: And that&#8217;s fluid. So then on the post editor, you can allow styles to be changed dynamically through the editor settings. That is a PR that refers to the theme JSON. So you can I think, or to block extenders. Yeah, that&#8217;s for the extenders to update editor settings. Now you can make them dynamically. So you can have theme styles and then react to that, have through the editor provider. That&#8217;s highly technical and there is in the PR some example code for the experiments, but it helps theme developers or plugin developers to also change some of the styling dynamically, CSS or any other means. I think I&#8217;ll put that on the list of what&#8217;s new for developers on the developer blog. Where else? I think that we are on the end of 16.4 except for one more. There is an experiment for auto inserting blocks on the front end and the editor wire REST API. And the release post has an unusual amount of information about that, which is actually almost a… but it&#8217;s really cool how you can auto insert the&#8230; We talked about it, right?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We talked about it here at the&#8230; It&#8217;s the experimental auto insert on the block JSON file where you can then say, okay, on the core common template for instance, add as last. And you have before, you can add blocks before, after the block you added to or as a first child or last child through the block on the front end. So yeah, definitely try that out, test it. And definitely, there&#8217;s a tracking issue also linked in the release post so you can see what other plans are there for this feature because it&#8217;s still, as I said, experimental.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Documentation</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The documentation had a ton of changes, updates, and if you are struggling with some of the things because the documentation is not going far enough or deep enough, I would think that going through the release Changelog and look at the documentation issues to see what all changed.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So there is an API reference documentation for the interactivity API, which still is, it&#8217;s probably not coming for 6.4, but it&#8217;s definitely already in the Gutenberg plugin as a private API right now so core blocks can use it. There&#8217;s an update on the Gutenberg release process documentation. So if you are a contributor and you think about, &#8220;Oh, maybe I want to lead one of those Gutenberg plugin releases&#8221;, it&#8217;s definitely worth looking into it because it made it more fluid for new people that have had an experience with GitHub and Gutenberg, but they haven&#8217;t done a release yet. There&#8217;s also a getting startup guide for the interactivity API, started the block API version three has been documented now, and the create block package received support, for example, property and template defaults. So the scaffolding tool create-block is now a little bit more comprehensive in what it offers as a tool. I think that&#8217;s it. Any comments on those last three, four things that we talked about, I talked about?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Ellen Bauer</em>: Not too much. I need to check out the&#8230; That&#8217;s exciting that you mentioned the create-block tool because I love to use that. I haven&#8217;t used it for a while. Now, I need to come up with a new block idea.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah, yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Ellen Bauer</em>: Maybe not. I was so excited to do more design and theming again. I&#8217;m holding off with new block ideas.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah, you mentioned that you&#8230; Yeah, after creating so many custom blocks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Ellen Bauer</em>: Yeah, it&#8217;s a little bit&#8230; I loved it, but just working with customers that people, I think maybe because for us, knowing that we come from design and theme worlds, they get just way more excited about design and themes and patterns compared to blocks, the people who follow us in our work.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah, definitely, because you see something…</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Ellen Bauer</em>: Yeah, yeah, visually.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: It&#8217;s haptical, yeah. I think the barrier for entry for custom blocks is sometimes a little harder. I can see that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Ellen Bauer</em>: Yeah, it was really good for me to get into it and having that skill and I enjoyed it, but it&#8217;s a lot of work with you really have to put a lot of effort into your block to make them work and make them competitive. And yeah, at the moment, I don&#8217;t know if we want to do that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> We don&#8217;t do it because it&#8217;s easy, we do it because it&#8217;s hard, right?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Ellen Bauer</em>: It is true, but it needs to make sense too. We just started building blocks because there was so much missing. And at the moment, we are fine with what we have. I mean, there are a few ideas we have maybe for blocks, but at the moment, we can build the designs we want to build with the blocks available and with our custom blocks so it works. And yeah, if we ever run into something we can&#8217;t do, then we will just create a block. Actually, if you get into it, it&#8217;s not, like for most of the blocks, for most things, it&#8217;s not so hard, it&#8217;s actually pretty easy now. It&#8217;s cool.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah, and the create-block scaffolding tool has been worked on quite a lot in the last year and a half or so.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Ellen Bauer</em>: Yeah. Yeah, it&#8217;s amazing. Yeah. In the beginning, I used to not like, I didn&#8217;t even have that available. Since we have that available, it&#8217;s really easy to, actually, it&#8217;s really easy to build custom blocks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah. And now, it&#8217;s a little bit more flexible as well because sometimes you, especially for agency developers who roll out just one plugin with all the blocks, you can now tell the scaffolding tool to just not create the whole plugin to just create a directory for one block and have the rest of it there. You can also distinguish between static block and dynamic block just with a command there or a flag respectively, and you can create your own templates. So if you have a process for creating blocks, you can make the tool work with your process as well with creating templates.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Gutenberg 16.5</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>So Gutenberg 16.5 was released this week, actually yesterday, and the release was done by Sioban Bamber and her release post is also online. And this version is again, bug fixes and had a focus on enriching the command palette even more and customized some more of the blocks that had it featured 219 pull requests by 63 contributors, including five new.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So we are not talking through 219 line items with you, we only pick a few and that is the command. And that is getting to through the features. There was added new block related commands again to the palette, which was the add block selection, block transforms, block duplicate, copy, remove, edit commands like that. So when you highlight something, you can then have a command that transform to, and then it gives you a list of blocks that you can. So it&#8217;s quite an interesting push on those command, creating new commands for that. If you want to follow along and you have plugins that use the block editor and the site editor, there is some documentation in the dev notes for 6.3 on how to create new commands that you can then add to your plugin. So definitely something to look into. There were also fixes to make it render well in smaller view ports and support the commands without icons and make it update the preview in new tab command to reuse the right module for that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah, and so those were some of the items that enhances the command palette. It also, in 16.5, there were some components updates and one of them is, we talked in 16.4 about the progress bar that also get additional update with this release 16.5, but there&#8217;s also an update to the modal component that it adds now a header action prompt to enable buttons or other elements to be injected into the header, which is pretty cool. And then enhances the overlay into action as well. So that is of course so much more interesting for developers, but it also is developers for blocks as well as for plugin developers because they can reuse the WordPress components.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The column block received two enhancements. One is a stretch option for the blocks vertical alignment options, meaning that if a two-stretch through the full column, even if the others were longer. So if you have a three-column block, then one column can be shorter or longer than the other columns. And that was hard to correct with a spacer block, we talked about it, but that of course what a spacer block was good for. And now, you have a vertical alignment option where you say, okay, just stretch this to the full space. And then especially when you have backgrounds on them, it looks much nicer when the backgrounds are all in the same length of that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Ellen Bauer</em>: That&#8217;s very helpful. I haven&#8217;t actually tested that, but it sounds very helpful. I have to retest it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah. Well, anybody should test it to see it actually does what you want it to do.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Ellen Bauer</em>: That sounds really helpful.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah, I&#8217;ve struggled with that every time when I use a columns block that my columns are not lined up and then I fiddle 90% there and then the last 10%, I fiddle a half an hour with a spacer block to get it all matching up in that, yeah. And the second enhancement I wanted to mention is that now, if you press enter on an empty paragraph at the end, then you get exit out of the columns block. There was no way to, with a keyboard, to get out of the columns block. Now you can when you&#8217;re done writing and then you hit enter on an empty paragraph at the end of the block that you get out of it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Ellen Bauer</em>: That also makes a lot of sense.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Ellen Bauer</em>: Yeah. I haven&#8217;t used the columns like that much, to be honest, myself. I have to check it out again.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah, it&#8217;s much more versatile now, especially with the different backgrounds for each column, different&#8230; You can do all kind of different&#8230; The single column has now so many design tools that it&#8217;s really helpful for your designs. There was some lacking design tools. They were only available for the full, for the columns block.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Ellen Bauer</em>: For the main.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah, for the main column and now, it&#8217;s all you get…</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Ellen Bauer</em>: For the…</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: &#8230; yeah, for the single column. Yeah, we always have to distinguish between the columns block and the column block. Yeah, and then other block updates like the file block got spacing options, the image block got aspect ratio support for the light box, the post content block got color controls. And this is the last one I wanted to mention is that the block titles have been changed to remove posts from it. So those are the ones like post author, post title, post content, post&#8230; Yeah. So because they&#8217;re pretty redundant, if it&#8217;s a title.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Ellen Bauer</em>: Yeah, there were a lot.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: &#8230; can be a post title and a page title and then it&#8217;s the author, but it&#8217;s the post author block on a page, why would I do that? So it makes more sense, but it also changes the alphabetical list of things. So if you wanted to look for titles, you always put title in and it gave you in the inserter the post title, but now it just says title. So some people are all very tuned in into what they see in the inserter and this makes the visual inserter a little bit different when it doesn&#8217;t have posts in it, yeah. They might not recognize it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah. So the global styles now got a feature to reset to the default global styles revision thing, and then also reduce the visibility check on two to one revision. So you don&#8217;t&#8230; Yeah, if you only have one revision, there is no visibility check there. That&#8217;s just one of the refinements of things. On the block editor, there&#8217;s now a…</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Ellen Bauer</em>: That is the&#8230; I haven&#8217;t actually looked into that, allow the layout controls to be disabled per block from theme JSON, but that sounds very helpful. But the next one, the fluid typography at minimum and maximum view port for that, like the theme JSON we can, in a theme, can configurate that ourselves. That&#8217;s what it means, right?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Right, right. Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Ellen Bauer</em>: Yeah, that&#8217;s so helpful because yeah, that&#8217;s something that didn&#8217;t really work for now, like creating designs with especially a larger typography sometimes. You only want that obviously in larger screens and you couldn&#8217;t really control it. That&#8217;s really, really helpful to have. I love that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah. There was also a bug fix in an earlier version, I don&#8217;t know it was 16.2 or 16.1 where you could also, it changed the progression from screen size, a big font down to smaller screen sizes, it now has a different algorithm to do that, so it actually works. So it actually goes smaller on a smaller screen. Sometimes when you have, I don&#8217;t know, 160 big letters, even if you scroll them down to a minimum size, it wouldn&#8217;t scroll down. But now, you can also hard code those minimum and maximum with the theme JSON. So it&#8217;s even more control now than you just rely on the algorithm to do that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Ellen Bauer</em>: Yeah, and also the layout controls. I mean, from my perspective, anything that we can get control of where theme JSON is amazing because yeah, it just makes it so much more flexible to have everything there. So to disable the layout controls per block basis I think is also pretty neat. I love to see that. Yeah, it&#8217;s really cool to see that there&#8217;s just more fine control and yeah, things just start to work way better.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: So what else is in there? I&#8217;m scrolling, scrolling through that what I wanted to do. But in the block editor, there&#8217;s also one PR that didn&#8217;t get any notice anywhere else except here in the Gutenberg Changelog, but also in Gutenberg Changelog podcast that there&#8217;s now support for container queries in editor CSS. Container queries means okay, if the container is something, the CSS changes in opposed to view port or media queries. And what happened was when if you enqueued a CSS file that used container queries, there would be an error message on the block editor. And that has been fixed and now, theme developers and designers can now use container queries in their CSS files without any problems with the block editor. I think that&#8217;s a step in the right direction because container queries are the new thing with CSS for, well, I don&#8217;t know how long, but I think it&#8217;s a better way to make a website or design flexible on screen size or container size rather than&#8230; The browser size rather than the screen size.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So that is definitely a step in the right direction to be a little bit updated with the modern CSS. For developers, again, interesting that the style engine now includes namespace in layout class names for non-core blocks. So it&#8217;s a very slight change, but it makes it so much more controllable that you now can use a theme slugs namespace on your class names for your core blocks and it&#8217;s still for your blocks, your custom blocks, and it will be in the style engine and you can use your CSS. It&#8217;s consistent, you don&#8217;t have to&#8230; It&#8217;s not so arbitrary anymore. And you can override your other people&#8217;s stuff when you can add your namespace there. It looks a little bit unwieldy when you look at the CSS class name, but it&#8217;s definitely like so before, it only said my block, my test block is layout-constrained and now, my block, create-block, my test block is layout-constrained. So it adds the namespace just after the WP block in your CSS automatically.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Ellen Bauer</em>: Wow. Yeah, that makes sense. It just gives you more control.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Gives you more control and isolate certain CSS in class names. Yeah. All right.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Experiments</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>There are two, no three experiments now in Gutenberg. One is the backend for the fonts library is now in the plugin, and then there is also a feature to connect a paragraph to a meta custom field. So there is an effort to have a user interface to connect certain blocks attributes to a custom field, and this is the first test. It&#8217;s very early, there is a little UI with it, but that is definitely something for extensibility for plugin developers to test out that you can, when you register your meta field, that you also can add them to the sidebar and allow connections to certain blocks with it. I think that&#8217;s a terrific idea and it fills a gap that is missing, and it helps with implementers when they use something like ACF to create meta fields and then they can just add them to a decent blocks, but it&#8217;s very early stages so it needs people to be testing but also to discuss that with the core developers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then the last one is a bootstrap minimal sync package. Well, it doesn&#8217;t, the name of the PR doesn&#8217;t really tell you what it actually is, but it&#8217;s part of the real-time collaboration efforts for phase three. Riad has put in little experiments and it&#8217;s really just a prototype or a proof of concept where you can have multiple people work on posts at the same time and see how that works. It uses the team has decided or thinks that the best external library to use is the Yjs library that uses web sockets and other in the pipeline tools. And yeah, it&#8217;s just the beginning of that little piece of it. And if you read through the PR, you hear a lot that&#8217;s not working, but the things, the main thing should be working. So test it out, try it out and just see how it feels.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Ellen Bauer</em>: I mean, that&#8217;s exciting to be able to start looking into it. I want to try it out.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah, I think Riad did two years ago, already had a site that&#8217;s called asblocks.com where he tested some of that already. So this is bringing it into the Gutenberg repo and see how it works with actually a real implementation, yeah. So I&#8217;m just looking also at the fonts library. There is in the PR, it&#8217;s a backend test, but in the PR, there is a video where you can see how it would fit into front end view as well. I don&#8217;t think there&#8217;s UI yet in there, but the experiment is you need to turn it on so you as a developer can use the REST endpoints to figure out how you can include it into your plugin. If you are a plugin developer that works with fonts and has some of the functionality in there, it&#8217;s probably good to start working with it.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Documentation</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>And then there we are again, a ton of updates in the documentation, especially I just want to point out one page and that&#8217;s the page curating the editor experience because it also now includes how to include the starter patterns for templates and that it&#8217;s documented now, but that page is something I point many people to when they say, &#8220;Well, I don&#8217;t want our users to have access to this, that and other&#8221; and I said, &#8220;Well, you have tools to make them disappear, to disable things or to curate that a little bit further&#8221; and that&#8217;s the page that I point people to when they need to explore how they can switch off some of the functionality or some of the features of the design controls and global styles as well. Do you have any&#8230; Oh no, no, one more. I&#8217;m sorry, one more for the benefits and…</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Ellen Bauer</em>: It&#8217;s a lot, I mean…</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: It&#8217;s a lot, yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Ellen Bauer</em>: It&#8217;s a lot.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Ellen Bauer</em>: For Node and NPM, no?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Ellen Bauer</em>: For the building tool update, get update?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah. The Gutenberg repo now update the minimum node version to 16 and NPM version to eight. Up until now, I was still working on minimum version 14 and I think six for NPM, but now you need at least be on 16 and on eight for NPM to build with Gutenberg and to, in some of the packages, require now the higher versions. It was mainly updated for I think the fund&#8217;s API, well, I&#8217;m not quite sure, I&#8217;m sorry. I might be misleading. There was a reason why it was happening now because one of the features, either the interactivity API or the fonts API or something like that, required a higher version of it. And so now, yeah, all the build processes now. So on the repo, you might want to rebase them and update your node install. Yeah, other external libraries also got updates like the Storybook or Learner or TypeScript Storybook is now on version 7, Learners on 7.14 and Typescript on 5.1, but that&#8217;s all for now. Now, we are at the end of it. Did you see anything that you wanted to explore that we overlooked?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Ellen Bauer</em>: No, I got a bit more quiet to the end of it. I&#8217;m sorry. It&#8217;s like I&#8217;m sliding into bed time time-wise, sadly.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: So what time is it there?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Ellen Bauer</em>: My energy level goes a little bit down. Yeah, it&#8217;s not that late. It&#8217;s just like toddler mom late. It&#8217;s 10:00.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Oh, yeah. No, it&#8217;s getting close to my bedtime too. So I only have one more thing on the agenda for today and that is the admin design kickoff post that was posted by section. And we only can, our listeners certainly need to go there and read it themselves, but yeah, dear listeners but also go there especially…</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Ellen Bauer</em>: Very exciting.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: &#8230; it&#8217;s very exciting and it shows you where the site editor design can merge into WP admin in various different ways. And which part of it excites you most? You read through it?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Ellen Bauer</em>: The merge part because yeah, this side editor, it just looks like yeah, so it&#8217;s more modern and I can&#8217;t wait for it to merge as much as possible, as fast as possible. Just yeah, because it just represents what WordPress has to offer way more, like coming from a design background myself too. Yeah, we just want to see, see it more clean and modern and just more exciting to work in it, I think, and just more attractive, to make it more attractive to new users and it&#8217;s just beautiful.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah. And I like…</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Ellen Bauer</em>: And I love the site editing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Yeah. Design?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Ellen Bauer</em>: Yeah, the design of the site editing. So I can&#8217;t wait to have all of WordPress look like that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Oh, I think you need to have some patience because…</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Ellen Bauer</em>: I know.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: &#8230; it&#8217;s going to take many, many major releases.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Ellen Bauer</em>: I know. Yeah, sadly. If it would be up to me, we would do tomorrow.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah, you and me both. I know. But what I like about it is that it&#8217;s more contained. So when you have a plugin right now, a plugin can put itself into the menus on the left-hand side and it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Ellen Bauer</em>: Yeah, yeah, that surround it. Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: But now, you have a plugin section and then a plugin, and then whenever you click on it, the plugin takes over your screen, but it&#8217;s all plugin-oriented. So you have your tabs, you have your everything. And if you want to get out of the setting, you just do the back button and you&#8217;re back to the WordPress part. I really like those.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Ellen Bauer</em>: That&#8217;s true. Yeah. I mean, that&#8217;s the biggest complaint too. We hear from people that it&#8217;s like if a plugin can take over WordPress, it looks wild and it&#8217;s sad for WordPress when that happens. And all the promotions and whatever some people put in there, we don&#8217;t want to have that. And also finding plugin settings because some put them there and others there, and I think it just grew organically and we have to now improve that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah. And I think it&#8217;s also…</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Ellen Bauer</em>: Just for users, I mean, it&#8217;s for the users. We do it not to punish people, but to make it a better user experience because at the moment, it&#8217;s just suffering.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: But I also can see that it&#8217;s so much helpful for the plugin developers to have a coherent WordPress design system that they can rely on and don&#8217;t have to come up with all the interfaces themselves because that code needs to be managed and maintained.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Ellen Bauer</em>: I like that you say that. And probably at the moment, a lot of people won&#8217;t agree, but I think too, you have to control that experience. I like it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah. Well, then the control of the experience you still have, just the design. So the user sees the same components over and over again and knows what to do with them. And what they do is the plugins definitely have a freedom on there, but I think if some of the plugins that are really big plugins can rely. And we had a live Q&amp;A on the Gutenberg Times about that with the people from the developers from GiveWP, they do their whole revamp of their plugin based on the WordPress packages and components so that the open source project is actually maintaining their code. And they did additional of course customization on that, but they only have to maintain those instead of the whole plugin.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Ellen Bauer</em>: Makes their life easier. Yeah, makes everyone&#8217;s lives easier.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah, and also the…</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Ellen Bauer</em>: I think so, too.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: &#8230; and also the feedback loop is now about WordPress&#8217; core elements and not about what the plugin can do and the bug fixes can be in core. It&#8217;s fixed upstream instead of just in the plugin, if there is something there that needs to be fixed.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Ellen Bauer</em>: That makes sense. Yeah, I love that. I can&#8217;t wait.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah. Dear listeners, I don&#8217;t know if I shared that post with you, but I will post it again in the show notes with the live Q&amp;A with the GiveWP developers, Jason Adams and John Weinstein probably yeah, it was the beginning of July. We had that live Q&amp;A and we have the transcript and the video and all the resources there, so you can follow up on that. Anyway, well, it was so great to walk with you through those Changelog items.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ellen, thank you so much. And before we come to the end, do you have any announcements or comments that you will like our listeners know? And if people want to get in touch with you, where is a good spot to find you?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Ellen Bauer</em>: So first of all, thank you for having me. Yeah, I hope I could contribute a little bit to this episode.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: A lot, a lot. Yes, no.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Ellen Bauer</em>: Yeah, so getting in contact with&#8230; So we have our website, ElmaStudio on AinoBlocks both work. And yeah, I&#8217;m still on, I still call it Twitter, I don&#8217;t care. Instagram and YouTube. I actually just about to get into creating a few new YouTube videos, so it&#8217;s all Elma Studio there on all the socials, except Twitter is my name, Ellen Bauer. Yeah, just on our website. And news is just that we are about to finish a new free theme and it&#8217;s inspired by the statement I made earlier that I just wanted to blog again. So we&#8217;re going to do a little blog theme that was just a design idea we had, Manu and I had and we are like, &#8220;Just, let&#8217;s do it.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I&#8217;m actually excited to create a little private blog on this design and we have it almost ready, I think. I hope it will land in the WordPress arc repository within the next four weeks or so, depending on what we still need to do. And then there&#8217;s a second one in the works as well that is just a wrap up of a redesign we did, and we had all these materials and patterns and templates ready and we&#8217;re like, &#8220;Let&#8217;s do a theme out of that&#8221;. So that&#8217;s going to be another free theme coming as well. Yeah, just fun projects we did over the last month.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: I&#8217;m looking so much forward to that. Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Ellen Bauer</em>: Yeah. We just wanted to create something simple for a change and we&#8217;re like, &#8220;Let&#8217;s do that, just simple block themes or easy smaller themes, make them free themes&#8221;. So that&#8217;s what we did just out of fun, which is cool to do that too. Yeah, so that&#8217;s coming from us. Others, I don&#8217;t have anything else to say except thank you for having me. It was really exciting and it helped me a lot to catch up on things actually, which is so cool.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Oh, good.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Ellen Bauer</em>: And yeah, I&#8217;m just amazed and excited about all the changes coming and all the fine-tuning. It&#8217;s really so, so cool to see WordPress coming together in that way. Like you said, with the admin and stuff, it&#8217;s still a way to go, but I mean, we can see the first glimpses of that and really beautiful to see WordPress going into that direction. I&#8217;m really excited.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah. Well, I&#8217;m glad to be working with you on the 6.4 release. And dear listeners, before we end the show, I want to remind everyone the show notes will be published on gutenbergtimes.com/podcast. This is episode 88.

On WordPress as a platform for empowerment and change, Josepha shared, “The more people that know about WordPress, the more people can access the incredible opportunities that WordPress can provide.” And that sustaining the platform for future generations ensures these opportunities will persist. She added, “We exist for as long as people want to use our software.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The community is the key to sustaining WordPress, and Josepha touched on the importance of WordCamps, workshops, and events that create value, promote inclusivity,&nbsp; and spark inspiration. WordPress can be a catalyst for positive change in the life of a contributor, end user, or site builder.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Concluding her keynote, Josepha asked the audience to think about the story they’d want to tell about themselves and their time in WordPress; and the story they would want WordPress to tell the world.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What’s Next for Gutenberg</h2>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n\n</div>\n\n\n\n<p>Matt began his keynote with a touch of nostalgia, referring to a comment on his personal blog in 2003 by WordPress Co-founder <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/mikelittle/\">Mike Little</a>, and then looked ahead to the most recent release, WordPress 6.3. As this year’s largest release, it includes new features such as the Command Palette, a quick way (⌘+k on Mac or Ctrl+k on Windows) to search your site and access common commands.</p>\n\n\n\n<a href=\"https://wordpress.org/download/releases/6-3/\"><img width=\"1024\" height=\"535\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2023/08/6.3-Release-Edition-Featured-Image.png?resize=1024%2C535&ssl=1\" alt=\"WordPress 6.3 Lionel\" class=\"wp-image-15795\" /></a>\n\n\n\n<p>Matt continued, “WordPress never rests, so right around the corner is <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/6-4/\">WordPress 6.4</a> on Nov 7… with some cool new features.” He shared that 6.4, like 5.6, will be an underrepresented gender-led release. A new default theme, <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2023/08/24/introducing-twenty-twenty-four/\">Twenty Twenty-Four</a>, is tailored for entrepreneurs and small businesses, photographers and artists, and writers and bloggers. Additionally, 6.4 will feature integrated font management and Image block options to expand single images for optimal viewing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Looking further into the future, Matt highlighted Phase 3 of the Gutenberg project, which will focus on workflows and collaboration, “moving WordPress from a single-player to a multi-player tool.” In that spirit of collaboration, a new <a href=\"https://wordpress.slack.com/archives/C05PY7QLR5F\">#LMS</a> working group will also bring WordPress learning management systems together to improve the web standards for courses and learning content.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Beyond Phase 3, Matt shared thoughts about what it means to support WordPress many years from now. A new <a href=\"https://wordpress.com/100-year/\">100-Year Plan</a> from WordPress.com is an exploration into long-term planning for your online presence. He encouraged attendees to be inspired by the region&#8217;s history, reflecting on what it would mean to honor the past while anticipating and planning for the future.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Q&amp;A</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>A Q&amp;A session followed the keynotes, with questions submitted by the in-person audience and live stream viewers.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n\n</div>\n\n\n\n<p>Additional questions will be answered in a future post on <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/project/\">make.WordPress.org/project/</a>.

Users now have access to more block-related commands for block transforms and block actions, including the following:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>all transforms&nbsp;<em>to</em>&nbsp;the block has defined (e.g. to cover, to gallery, to columns, to file, to group, to media and text, for an image block)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>these block actions: paste styles, copy, ungroup, group, moveTo, insertAfter, insertBefore, remove, duplicate)</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Together, these new commands not only enrich the command palette’s functionality but also improve the distraction-free mode by offering immediate access to basic functions,&#8221; Automattic-sponsored Gutenberg contributor Siobhan Bamber said in the release post.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>Improving the discovery of these new commands may prove challenging.

Users with a keen eye may notice a new search icon aligned to the right, a reduced width, darker icon color, and more subtle changes.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<img width=\"1200\" height=\"908\" src=\"https://149611589.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/updated-command-palette.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-148244\" />image credit: Gutenberg PR <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/53117\">#53117</a>\n\n\n\n<p>Gutenberg 16.5 adds more block supports to the Details block, Post Content block, and File block to make them more customizable with controls for colors, block spacing, and padding.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This update includes many more small enhancements and bug fixes, including improvements to the writing flow, build tooling, fluid typography, existing Command Palette commands, Snackbar component, and Global Styles.

The site was founded by Brian Krogsgard in 2013, and now runs an active Slack community with 2,083 members, a weekly newsletter with 4,300 subscribers, and a job board.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As a testament to the community&#8217;s continued growth, Post Status <a href=\"https://poststatus.com/joost-and-marieke-join-post-status-as-equity-partners/\">announced</a> it has added WordPress veterans Joost de Valk and Marieke van de Rakt as equity partners who have invested cash in the business. They will also be taking on active roles in leading the Post Status community &#8211; de Valk as CTO and van de Rakt as an advisor and editorial contributor. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Post Status has created the most important networking possibilities for us in the past and helped us grow our WordPress businesses,&#8221; van de Rakt said. &#8220;It seems only fit to contribute and to take on an active role in the Post Status community at this point.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Post Status CEO Cory Miller said the organization will be moving forward with &#8220;the same vision and values &#8211; supporting the business of WordPress, with an emphasis on agency owners.&#8221; Co-owner Lindsey Miller will be taking on a new role as CMO. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Although maintaining the professional community remains their first priority, Post Status will be expanding with two new initiatives this year that will benefit both partners and members. The team has soft launched the new <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"http://poststatus.com/\" target=\"_blank\">poststatus.com</a>, featuring a new <a href=\"https://poststatus.com/wordpress-companies/\">Partner Directory</a> that showcases WordPress businesses. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;I believe a healthy growing business ecosystem inside of WordPress is absolutely key to WP continued growth and success,&#8221; Cory Miller said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;We want to get a little more organized, professional as an industry, and that means cooperating, communicating, working together, with Post Status being that collective brand, showcasing the agencies, software and professionals of WordPress better.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;The next step is our directory. We want to say, here’s our professional industry for those looking at WordPress for their web projects.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In addition to ramping up editorial commentary and analysis on industry trends, with the depth of expertise of new partners de Valk and van de Rakt, Post Status is in the early stages of planning an annual summit. It will be similar to WordPress&#8217; contributor summit but for businesses and individuals who are making their way in the marketplace.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;The second step is to gather together, talk business and what are we seeing, what are the issues, challenges, and opportunities as an industry,&#8221; Miller said. &#8220;That naturally gives us focus and initiatives to cooperate on together.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Most industries have this already.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Doctors, lawyers, big businesses have these kinds of venues and platforms for conversations about the state of their industry. We need that for WordPress and Post Status is taking next steps to do so.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>These two initiatives are next on the organization&#8217;s roadmap, and with the new partnership they now have the resources to execute on them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Showcase the collective, that’s our directory,&#8221; Miller said. &#8220;And gather us together to have the key conversations we need about where we’re going as an industry and community. That’s our summit.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sponsors are what keeps the lights on at Post Status. The organization has historically been focused on driving individual membership for WordPress professionals but is shifting its focus on businesses as members now. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;We want every WP pro in Post Status, this is their home, their trade association,&#8221; Miller said. &#8220;Those who work at WP companies or with WP as part of their gig, we always want to welcome them in to PS.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Post Status is one of the few WordPress organizations that has been operating for longer than a decade. Now that the Pressnomics event has been retired for four years, the WordPress community is sorely in need of an event where the business-focused community can connect and help each other grow WordPress&#8217; success in the wider industry. Post Status is the organization best-suited to step into this role.

Contributors are attempting to build the ultimate multi-purpose theme that can be used for nearly any kind of website, highlighting the unmatched flexibility of building with blocks.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<img width=\"1600\" height=\"1066\" src=\"https://149611589.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/TT4.jpeg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-148180\" />image credit: <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2023/08/24/introducing-twenty-twenty-four/\">Introducing Twenty Twenty-Four</a>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;The idea behind Twenty Twenty-Four is to make a default theme that can be used on any type of site, with any topic,&#8221; core contributorJessica Lyschik said. &#8220;Because of that, and contrary to past years, it has no single topic. Instead, three use cases were explored: one more tailored for entrepreneurs and small businesses, one tailored for photographers and artists and one specifically tailored for writers and bloggers.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Last year&#8217;s default theme, <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/design/2022/08/10/twenty-twenty-three-default-theme-project-kickoff/\">Twenty Twenty-Three</a>, was a stripped-back and minimal version of Twenty Twenty-Two, with a strong focus on community-submitted style variations. Like its predecessor, Twenty Twenty-Four will put the spotlight on some of the latest WordPress design features.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Twenty Twenty-Four will be a block theme fully compatible with all the site editor tooling and it will surface new design tools like the details block or vertical text,&#8221; Lyschik said. &#8220;Another key intent for the theme is to properly present whole page patterns and template variations so that users don’t need to assemble whole pages themselves, thus easing up their site building process.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<img width=\"1600\" height=\"840\" src=\"https://149611589.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/TT4-full-page-designs.jpeg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-148184\" />\n\n\n\n<p>Whole page patterns are a critical feature that all of the best block themes provide, as most people feel daunted when starting from a blank slate. If a whole page pattern is already pre-inserted on a new website install, users are light years ahead in their site building efforts.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Twenty Twenty-Four features the Cardo font for headings and a sans-serif system font for paragraph text. Cardo is an Old Style serif typeface designed by David J. Perry in 2002 for “classicists, biblical scholars, medievalists, and linguists.” It grounds the design with a bit of sophistication but should be easy to swap out with the <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/wordpress-6-4-roadmap-includes-typography-management-features-new-blocks-and-twenty-twenty-four-default-theme\">typography management features coming in 6.4</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The initial previews of the theme don&#8217;t stray far from many of the traditional website designs you might see browsing businesses or portfolios. It leans more towards  providing an invisible framework for the user&#8217;s own creations, instead of pushing a single, opinionated design. This design lets the Site Editor and design controls shine as tools that can unlock human creativity on the screen. So far it has received positive feedback on the WordPress.org announcement.

Until recently, Lahaina was home to Organic Themes co-founder David Morgan, who hosted the Maui WordPress meetups for years, and co-organized WordCamp Maui in 2015.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Morgan and his co-founder Jeff Milone have been best friends since high school. In 2007, Morgan sold everything and moved to Oahu, working as a freelance designer while living out of his car after arriving. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;While living on Oahu, Jeff and I began working long-distance on freelance WordPress projects,&#8221; Morgan said. &#8220;This led to the idea of starting a theme business together, and I invited Jeff to Hawaii in 2009. While he was visiting me on Oahu, we flew to Maui and fell in love with the island. We decided to start our business there.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Organic Themes operated out of Lahaina for ten years before Morgan eventually returned to the mainland to start his family in Sarasota, Florida.

My name is Nathan Wrigley. Jukebox is a podcast which is dedicated to all things WordPress. The people, the events, the plugins, the blocks, the themes, and in this case, the state of the WordPress community in Australia.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;d like to subscribe to the podcast, you can do that by searching for WP Tavern in your podcast player of choice, or by going to WPTavern.com forward slash feed forward slash podcast. And you can copy that URL into most podcast players.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you have a topic that you&#8217;d like us to feature on the podcast, I&#8217;m keen to hear from you, and hopefully get you all your idea featured on the show. Head to WPTavern.com forward slash contact forward slash jukebox and use the form there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So on the podcast today, we have Jo Minney.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Jo is the founder of a small business that specialises in building websites for organisations, mainly nonprofits and the tech industry. With a background in engineering, Jo decided to shift her focus to website development using WordPress. She was excited about the WordPress community and joined her local meetup, eventually becoming an organizer.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Jo is keen for the WordPress community in Australia to grow, and has been making significant contributions to that growth.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In this episode, Jo shares her insights on the challenges of organizing WordCamps and meetups in Australia, where the large size of the country, and small population presents some unique obstacles. If you&#8217;re used to a European or north American setting, it&#8217;s really interesting how the geography of the country presents challenges not seen elsewhere.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We discussed the importance of paying speakers and covering their travel expenses to create equal opportunities for freelancers and small businesses, as well as to give the Australian community a stronger voice.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We talk about her journey with WordPress, starting from her early days as a coder in a different field, and navigating the community online. Jo highlights the need for in-person opportunities to learn and connect with others. Especially in a global community where the time zone differences and online platforms can be limiting.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We chat about the challenges faced by the Australian WordPress community from limited resources and burnout, to the struggle of attracting new organizers and attendees. Jo share some exciting success stories, such as organizing WordPress events and hosting a successful do_action event.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We briefly get into the need for more diverse voices and the importance of fostering, a supportive and inclusive environment. If you&#8217;re interested in hearing about how the WordPress community is doing in Australia, this episode is for you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can find all of the links in the show notes by heading over to WPTavern.com forward slash podcast. Where you&#8217;ll find all the other episodes as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so without further delay, I bring you Jo Minney.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I am joined on the podcast today by Jo Minney. Hello Jo.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:03:40] <strong>Jo Minney:</strong> Nice to be here.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:03:41] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Yeah thank you for joining me. Jo is in Western Australia which means that the collision of the time zones is pretty severe on this one. It&#8217;s the middle of the afternoon for me which means it&#8217;s very, very late in the evening for Jo. So first up Jo, thank you very much for staying the course and being with us.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I guess my first question, as always, it&#8217;s a pretty banal one but it&#8217;s worth asking anyway. Given that we&#8217;re on a WordPress podcast, we&#8217;re going to be talking about the WordPress community in Australia in particular. Would you mind just spending a moment just telling us who you are? What your relationship is with WordPress? Perhaps a little bit about the kind of job that you have, and the role that you have and all of that good stuff.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:04:22] <strong>Jo Minney:</strong> Sure I can absolutely do that. So I am a small business founder like a lot of people that work with WordPress. I run I guess what you&#8217;d call a micro business. I have a grand total of three people in my team, and we build websites for mainly organizations. We work a lot with nonprofits and also a bit with the tech industry. So my background is actually engineering, and I threw in the towel and decided I didn&#8217;t want to do engineering anymore and started building websites instead.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So in a nutshell what I do now, and how I use WordPress. And when I first started using it I got really excited when I found out about the community that was behind it and things like meetups and WordCamps. And that was yes, this is so exciting and went and joined our local meetup and none had been running for the last year and a half. So that was a bit sad. And then I reached out to the organizer who had previously run them and was like, hey, what&#8217;s going on? And she&#8217;s like here you go. And so I became lead organizer and the rest, I guess, is as they say history.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:05:27] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Did you find the community more or less as soon as you found WordPress? Did you have a nice bit of serendipity there? Because when I discovered WordPress it was many years before I realized that there was any kind of community. I purely viewed it as a piece of freely available software. And whilst I understood that the freely available nature of it meant that there was community involvement in building the software, I had no conception there was a community of people who would be meeting up in the real world or getting into the kind of discourse that they do, in all sorts of different directions. So yeah, to paraphrase that question, did you find the community right away?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:06:07] <strong>Jo Minney:</strong> I wouldn&#8217;t say right away, but fairly soon after I started using WordPress. So I had done a little bit of coding before I started using WordPress but in a very different environment, working as I said in engineering. I was really lucky that my husband, who&#8217;s also my business partner now, also works in development.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And when I first said I want to learn how to use WordPress and I&#8217;m going to use it to create my website for my consulting business, which back then was still in engineering, he was like no you can&#8217;t use WordPress. WordPress is the devil. He&#8217;s come around since then. He&#8217;s actually speaking at WordCamp US. We do a lot of collaboration projects now. So he builds custom web applications and my team do WordPress websites. And we do a lot of merging the two together and integrating them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When I first started using it I felt like a lot of the time the people that I was asking were a lot more superior at using it to me, and had a lot more experience. So reaching out online was a little bit intimidating. So I actually started looking quite early on in my journey for something that was in person, because it would enable me to kind of go and learn from other people without having to actively start asking questions on online forums, where often I was the only woman there, or I didn&#8217;t know if I was the only woman there, but I kind of had assumed in that space.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:07:30] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Yeah thank you. So in terms of the timeline of all of this, you may have mentioned it but forgive me I didn&#8217;t pick up on it. How far back are we going in history? What year? 2015, 2016, or later than that? Did you reach out and find these events?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:07:48] <strong>Jo Minney:</strong> Yeah, so I think I started using WordPress in 2017, quite recently compared to a lot of people that are in the WordPress community. And I took over the meetup as lead organizer I think in 2019. I could be wrong it could have been 2018, but it was either 2018 or 2019. So it was only a year or so into the first time that I had actually touched the platform.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:08:12] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Okay so pre pandemic you discovered the real world community. So paint a picture of what it&#8217;s like in Australia. Now clearly you&#8217;re going to be able to paint that picture better describing where you live. But if you&#8217;re able to give us more information about Australia more broadly that would be excellent as well. And maybe during the course of the next few minutes we can map out how things may have changed since 2017, 2018, 2019, to where they are now.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:08:42] <strong>Jo Minney:</strong> Yeah, that&#8217;s a great question. So I have a question for you in return, cause I know that you&#8217;ve been to Australia before. We talked about that earlier. Australia is pretty big. So do you want to have a stab at how big Australia is?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:08:57] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> In terms of square miles, or just multiples of the UK.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:09:01] <strong>Jo Minney:</strong> Either&#8217;s fine.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:09:02] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Okay so I would imagine that you could fit the UK into Australia, I&#8217;m going to pluck a number out of thin air, 35 times.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:09:09] <strong>Jo Minney:</strong> I actually have no idea how many times you can fit the UK into Australia but I do know that it is about the same size as the lower 48 in the US. So it&#8217;s like 7. 6 million square kilometers, versus 8 million square kilometers for the US. So they&#8217;re pretty comparable size wise.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Do you want to have a stab at what the population of Australia is compared to the population of the US?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:09:34] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Okay, so I&#8217;m going to guess Australia has 22 or 23 million people in it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:09:40] <strong>Jo Minney:</strong> It&#8217;s a little bit higher than that. It&#8217;s 26 and a half, thereabouts, million. Which is less than Texas. So think it&#8217;s really important to understand that one of the biggest challenges that we face here, and you would know this from having driven across the Nullarbor, is there&#8217;s nothing in the middle of Australia.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We only live around the outside. So if you imagine the entire US but only having people live around the coastal cities and having the entire population of that whole continent being less than Texas.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:10:13] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Yeah that&#8217;s fascinating. So I guess if you&#8217;re listening to this and you&#8217;re a North American, the distance that you would have to go from east to west is comparable from say going, I don&#8217;t know, from Virginia to California. They&#8217;re on the same kind of scale but the population is significantly smaller. I guess what you&#8217;re trying to say is we&#8217;re spread out.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:10:35] <strong>Jo Minney:</strong> Yeah, we really are. And I think if you&#8217;re in Europe, again, to travel the length of Australia or the width of Australia you&#8217;re traveling through multiple countries. Each of which probably has a higher population than what we do. So the challenge that we&#8217;ve got there is that our communities to start with, and I don&#8217;t just mean our WordPress communities, I mean our cities, the people that we have living here, are very small in comparison to a lot of other places in the world. So because our population is so spread out, it makes it really hard for us to hold in person events in the first place.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So that&#8217;s a challenge that we&#8217;ve always faced here in Australia in building our community. And it&#8217;s something we were slowly starting to overcome. And we did before the pandemic have meetups happening in, I think, five different cities around Australia. And then obviously the pandemic happened and all of that stopped.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But even before the pandemic started, in the city where I live, I mean it&#8217;s only 2 million odd people here, but we had never had a WordCamp in the whole time that WordCamps had started running.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So if you think about someone who&#8217;s just coming into the WordPress community for the first time, and they learn about all of this stuff and then they find out actually we&#8217;ve got no meetups running. We&#8217;ve got no WordCamps running. We don&#8217;t actually have a community here. It can be really sad, and really soul crushing I guess.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That&#8217;s kind of where I was at. So I got it in my head, I was like that&#8217;s it, I&#8217;m going to be the person that organizes the first WordCamp here in Perth. And to do that I reached out to a lot of the other organizers from around Australia, who are fantastic people. And some of them have been doing that for a really long time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And that&#8217;s probably the second challenge that we have which is burnout. And I know that this is not something unique to Australia. I know this happens everywhere. When you&#8217;ve got meetup organizers that are volunteers it&#8217;s not just rocking up for the time of the meetup and ordering some pizza. It&#8217;s organising speakers, it&#8217;s growing the community and actually making sure that people come along to it. There&#8217;s a lot that&#8217;s involved with it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And often it falls on one, maybe two, people to do that. And we really struggled to get more organizers, to get attendees, to get speakers. And when you look at that compounded with the fact that we have such a small population compared to the space we have, you can see how very quickly it becomes a challenge.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:13:04] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Yeah. I guess in Europe, as an example, the population density is extremely high. I&#8217;m guessing per square kilometre it probably is even higher than in the US. I don&#8217;t actually know if that&#8217;s true or not, but I&#8217;m imagining it is.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The point being there&#8217;s lots of people. So the reservoir of people who may stumble into the community within a hundred miles of where I live there are likely to be a dozen, two dozen, a hundred, whatever that number may be. Whereas where you are, that number is going to be significantly lower. And so if somebody steps into the community but then gets that burnt out, or just gets fed up, or moves on, or just doesn&#8217;t wish to contribute to those events, there really isn&#8217;t that pool of people that you can dip into which would be present in North America or other parts of the world, Europe and so on.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So if somebody moves on there&#8217;s often somebody that will take that role on again. And I know that in the recent past there have been discussions about whether or not, even in Europe and other places, the burnout and the replacement of people is more and more challenging. But I guess where you are it&#8217;s really acute.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:14:13] <strong>Jo Minney:</strong> Yeah absolutely. And I think another thing that became a challenge for us is, you mentioned earlier a mutual acquaintance of ours, Cameron. And he moved to the UK. He wasn&#8217;t the only one. We actually had two of our other organising committee who we had spent the last couple of years trying to build up that community, and they also moved either interstate or international.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I am back to being the only organizer now for our local meetup. And we&#8217;ve now got three meetups around Australia running. So Sydney is definitely the most recovered. And a big part of that is because it&#8217;s got Will spearheading it who is phenomenal. Who mentors WordCamps and stuff like that, and has a lot of contacts. And also just because Sydney has the biggest population of any of our cities in Australia.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Brisbane started up again. For anyone who doesn&#8217;t know Australia which is most people in the world, they&#8217;re in the the top right. So in the northeast of Australia. And our biggest WordCamp that we&#8217;ve ever had before the pandemic so it was November 2019 I think or maybe a bit earlier than that, it was in 2019 anyway. That was our biggest WordCamp we&#8217;ve ever had in Australia and that was 450 people.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:15:29] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Yeah that&#8217;s really interesting as a contrast, the last WordCamp London that I attended, which I think was in 2019. So that&#8217;s a subset of the events which go on in the UK. I think that event was about 600, something like that. WordCamp Europe is usually touching about 3,000. WordCamp US, although the numbers have been much smaller recently due to pandemic restrictions, you know eclipses 2,000 as well. So the magnitude, given everything that you&#8217;ve said, I guess we&#8217;re expecting the numbers to be lower.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Were you saying 400 as the big flagship event in Australia, the Sydney one? Were you saying 400 because you thought that was a small number, or were you just saying it because that is the number?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:16:11] <strong>Jo Minney:</strong> A little of both. 450 was actually in Brisbane. So I think actually a lot of the speakers at that had come from interstate, and that&#8217;s something that definitely we&#8217;ve noticed. Every WordCamp that we have in Australia people travel to it, because they&#8217;re so rare here. Even though it costs us an absolute fortune, we still have people flying to Brisbane, flying to Sydney, flying to Port Macquarie.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And an interesting thing that I noticed was that a lot of the speakers were the same across multiple WordCamps in Australia because again, it comes down to that not having a huge population and we struggle to find speakers for our meetups. So you can imagine it&#8217;s equally hard to find speakers for WordCamps.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So that&#8217;s a challenge there. Since post pandemic it&#8217;s become even harder. I know I&#8217;ve had the same conversation with the Brisbane organisers and the Sydney organisers. And I don&#8217;t know if this is something that other communities have experienced, but all three of us have found that our communities are essentially started from scratch again.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So the number of people that have come back from pre pandemic communities is basically zero. So we had one person at our first meetup when we restarted that had attended a meetup before, ever. It&#8217;s not a bad thing, but it&#8217;s still a thing. And it&#8217;s something that I think has also become a challenge because it means that there aren&#8217;t people who are experienced with running events and that sort of thing. And how to put the word out, and what&#8217;s involved in organising them, and speaking with who is around to help out with that load.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:17:43] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Yeah. It&#8217;s interesting. In the UK there&#8217;s several factors which are making it more difficult to get that community engagement back up to the levels that it was pre pandemic. The first one is obviously just related to people&#8217;s desire to go out. They may have dropped out of the community. So there&#8217;s the process of, as you&#8217;ve just described, starting from scratch. So that&#8217;s one thing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But also the cost of ever so many aspects of life has gone much, much higher than it was prior to the pandemic. Particularly the cost of venue hire. Venue hire over here has become significantly more expensive, orders of magnitude more expensive. And so something that may have cost X 5 years ago, or 3 years ago is now possibly 3 or 4 or 5 X for the exact same building, for the exact same duration. So there&#8217;s all sorts of circumstances contriving to make it as hard as possible I think. And if you&#8217;re starting from scratch, that is even more of an obstacle.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:18:48] <strong>Jo Minney:</strong> Yeah absolutely. And I am sure that London is probably about as expensive, maybe even more expensive, than Australia. So one of the things that I think is very different here, so those WordCamps that I talked about, even our biggest ones have always historically been at educational venues. So we&#8217;ve always used universities.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And the one that we were planning locally here was at a TAFE, which is a technical institute. I don&#8217;t know what you would call that in places that are not Australia. That&#8217;s sort of always the kind of places that we&#8217;re looking at and we&#8217;re not talking about flashy hotels and things with 2000 people or conference centers. We&#8217;re talking about a university during their down times. So even trying to keep those costs really low, it was actually a real struggle for us to be able to fund. And I say us, I wasn&#8217;t actually involved in the organising committee for the last one, because I was still fairly new to the community at the time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But speaking to Will and some of the other previous organizers about it, A they have to wait until the end of the year to find out the availability for those venues. So it makes planning kind of a challenge. And B, one of the things that WordCamp limited us to, or really pushed for, was for us to keep the ticket prices down at 50 Australian. Which is like 30 Euro or 30 US. So trying to do that and then cover the rest of it, even using a really comparatively cheap venue like a university, was really a struggle still to meet the budget.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And on top of that, in 2019 that was the first year that we&#8217;d had three WordCamps in Australia in the same year. So before that the most that we&#8217;d ever had was two. And I think that had only happened once. And what we found is that the organizers for those WordCamps were actually competing for funding. So the sponsors were like, oh I don&#8217;t want to fund WordCamp Sydney because we just funded WordCamp Brisbane, and it&#8217;s all the same people that are attending.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So that&#8217;s something that has really been something that we&#8217;ve noticed, and it&#8217;s something that we&#8217;re keeping in mind when we go into the future planning WordCamps. While we know that they are historically encouraged to be very local events, that&#8217;s something that we&#8217;ve got to keep in mind. We are potentially competing against other cities for that attention where we don&#8217;t want to be. We want to be helping each other grow because there&#8217;s not enough of us to be in competition. We&#8217;ve got to be helping each other out.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:21:15] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Yeah. It speaks to coordinating at a higher level doesn&#8217;t it? The idea that, let&#8217;s say there&#8217;s three or five, that they were A spread out geographically, B spread out over time so that you weren&#8217;t trying to compete in the same month for a WordPress event. And that obviously, you&#8217;ve got to go a little bit higher up the pecking order to figure out all of that stuff.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But from everything that you&#8217;ve said you sound fairly, I&#8217;m going to use an English colloquialism, you sound fairly chipper. Which means you sound fairly upbeat.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:21:47] <strong>Jo Minney:</strong> Optimistic. Hopeful.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:21:49] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Exactly. But I want to probe into this, if you&#8217;re willing. How do you really feel about this? Because I can imagine that with all these setbacks and no shows, people coming in smaller numbers, the feeling that the community is dwindling. Do you get moments where you just think, oh this is really hardly worth my time anymore? Do you ever get those moments where you just want to throw in the towel?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And if that is the case, I wonder if that is another problem which has to be dealt with, you know, people just getting fed up and moving on.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:22:17] <strong>Jo Minney:</strong> Yeah. I won&#8217;t lie. There&#8217;s definitely been times where I&#8217;ve been like, is it really worth it? I am the only volunteer contributor that I&#8217;m aware of, other than my husband who is fairly new to it, in my entire state.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We have one other contributor who&#8217;s full time at Automattic. So when it comes to the WordPress community everyone that I know is online. And that in itself can be really depressing. But it can also be really challenging for me to have a conversation with someone. And I do think that in person conversations are important, and you don&#8217;t communicate the same way online and over text and via Slack and things like that. Commenting on blog posts is what you do when you&#8217;re having a face to face conversation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And while decisions in the WordPress community aren&#8217;t made at WordCamps and meetups and things like that, conversations are started there. And those conversations help to drive future decisions. And that is really important. And it&#8217;s sad to me that Australia isn&#8217;t part of that conversation, and hasn&#8217;t been since definitely since pre Covid, but even before then we were struggling.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I think for me that&#8217;s one of the most disappointing things. For example, WordCamp Asia was earlier this year which was super exciting for us. There were some Australian people that attended that. There were no Australian speakers as far as I&#8217;m aware, which I don&#8217;t think is a bad thing because I think it was important for WordCamp Asia to really push for representation from Asian speakers, because that was the purpose of it. And I know if we were to ever have a WordCamp Australia in the future that we would be pushing to try and have as many local speakers as possible as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But then if we look at some of the bigger flagship camps there were two speakers at WordCamp Europe that were from Australia, that I&#8217;m aware of. So I did stalk and go through every single speaker to check, because what else am I going to do with my spare time that I don&#8217;t have?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So both of the speakers from Australia that were at WordCamp Europe were executives from companies that are very big. And I&#8217;m not going to name names. You can go find them yourself if you&#8217;re really interested, but they work for the Googles and the eBays and the News Corps.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And, my concern is that globally the voices that are coming out of Australia are not the ones that are doing the work of rebuilding the community. They represent big interests, not most interests. And to me that&#8217;s the most concerning thing about the lack of community here in Australia.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:24:51] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Yeah. There is this phrase which sometimes gets brought out that the people that can contribute to the project, there&#8217;s sometimes a feeling that it&#8217;s those that can afford to contribute to the project. So in the scenario that you just described, if your very successful company are willing to send you, then you are now sitting at the table where potentially some of those decisions are being made.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I realize that it&#8217;s far more complicated than that, but you have a voice because you&#8217;re able to go and prior success for the company that you work for, you know, it&#8217;s no reflection on that company. We want the companies to be successful but that&#8217;s just how it works. And it&#8217;s difficult for people, well such as yourself, to sort of feel like your voice is rising to the top and being heard, I guess.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:25:34] <strong>Jo Minney:</strong> A hundred percent. And you look at the cost of flights, for example. So it&#8217;s easy enough to say we&#8217;ll just go to some of these. Get more people and fund them to go over. But flights are like 65% more expensive now than they were pre pandemic, for international flights from Australia. That&#8217;s bonkers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I certainly can&#8217;t afford to pay out of my own money to go over there. And even getting sponsorship, there&#8217;s nothing really in it. There is things in it for people, but it is a challenge to communicate them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I like stats, you might&#8217;ve noticed that already Nathan. One of my favorite stats about why I think it&#8217;s important for people to start paying attention to the WordPress community in Australia? So we have the 14th largest market for eCommerce in the world. Which is cool sure. Do you know how much of the web or how much eCommerce on the web is powered by WooCommerce overall globally?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:26:30] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Oh no. I know it&#8217;s a significant amount, but don&#8217;t know exact number. Yeah I realize it&#8217;s very high.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:26:37] <strong>Jo Minney:</strong> Yeah like everyone knows the WordPress number, right? But nobody knows the WooCommerce number. I like this because I feel like it&#8217;s a better, accurate representation of websites that are being used. Whereas the WordPress number still takes into account a lot of sort of dormant sites and that sort of thing. So with WooCommerce it powers about 24% of eCommerce sites on the web globally.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In Australia however, it&#8217;s less than 15%, and Shopify leads with over 20%. So what that tells me, and this is obviously just my interpretation of that data, but it tells me that in Australia we don&#8217;t have the same recognition and understanding of WordPress and WordPress tools as what there is globally.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And that&#8217;s an opportunity for people who are earning lots of money from WordPress. For the Automattic&#8217;s and the Yoasts and these other big companies that have combined collectively an economy that&#8217;s like bigger than Tesla. It tells me that there is value in them paying more attention to Australia and helping us to rebuild the community because I don&#8217;t think that we can continue to do it the way that we&#8217;re trying at the moment.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:27:45] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Yeah that&#8217;s really interesting. That was a really interestingly presented fact because makes it, well it lays bare the opportunity that is maybe being left. The old adage of money being left on the table it kind of fits under that umbrella, doesn&#8217;t it?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It sounds like you are A, you&#8217;re very committed to the community. I guess you wouldn&#8217;t be on a podcast like this if you weren&#8217;t. But B, you&#8217;ve identified that there&#8217;s a problem. So C, I guess, is what do we do about the problem? Do you have any endeavors? Do you have any thoughts? Do you have any intuitions as to how these challenges might be overcome? How you might reinvigorate the community?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:28:24] <strong>Jo Minney:</strong> Yeah look I think a lot of people who are much smarter and more engaged and well versed in the WordPress community than me have already suggested a lot of the things that I look at and go that would really help us. Even though we&#8217;re not specifically the target audience for those things that are being championed.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And one of those big ones is, and I know it&#8217;s probably a drum that&#8217;s been beaten to death, but paying speakers or at least covering their travel. Because as I said, I think a lot of those conversations happen at WordCamps. And even if you&#8217;re not paying people to attend them or that sort of thing, by paying speakers you&#8217;re giving the same opportunities to the freelancers and those small businesses as you are to those companies that are working for Google and eBay.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I think that&#8217;s one thing that would go a long way towards evening the playing field, and allowing the Australian community to have a little bit more of a voice. And I know that there&#8217;s a huge amount of work that&#8217;s being done to push for that in the WordPress community by loads of different, amazing people.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And there are sponsorship options and stuff out there for people who are underrepresented in tech. But you know they have their challenges. I think that would go a long way towards helping.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:29:39] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> I just want to just interject there again and inject the geographical piece again. Because it&#8217;s so easy to forget that for where I live, really I can hop into a car and I can be at a local event within an hour, less. You know and typically more or less everybody in the UK could probably drive in one of the directions of the compass and find an event fairly quickly. May not be all that frequent, but at some point during the calendar year, it really is different isn&#8217;t it where you are? You know you may just drive off in the same compass direction as I do but you end up in the middle of the desert.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:30:13] <strong>Jo Minney:</strong> Or the ocean depending on which way you go.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:30:15] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> So there really aren&#8217;t those opportunities and the fact that you have to travel further, as you&#8217;ve described, the cost of airline transportation has gone through the roof. So it may be that you simply are nowhere near something. And so just having a little bit of an offset for the cost, the remuneration as you&#8217;ve said for speaking. Simply that may be enough to propel some people to have a different opinion of it, and to make the effort to go.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:30:40] <strong>Jo Minney:</strong> And I think the same thing goes, and it&#8217;s a similar argument, but for the volunteers who are organising. Maybe not all WordCamps but certainly flagship ones. When I was talking to Will about his experience with organising WordCamp Sydney back in 2019, he actually logged his hours for it and he logged 1,200 hours of volunteer work.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:31:03] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Wow.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:31:03] <strong>Jo Minney:</strong> And I spoke to one of the organizers, not even the lead organizer, just one of the organizers for WordCamp Europe, on a call for the training team last week. We have like a coffee hour every Friday. Only for me it&#8217;s wine hour because I have a 12 hour difference from everyone else. And he was saying that doesn&#8217;t surprise him at all. And he definitely feels like he logged at least that much as a volunteer for WordCamp Europe.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I think there&#8217;s something to be said at least for flagship WordCamps and for that sort of core organising committee who are essentially taking on a second full time job to give them some kind of reason to keep doing that. Otherwise we are just going to keep losing volunteers to people that want to pay them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:31:47] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> It&#8217;s interesting as well because, suddenly into my head I&#8217;m thinking, I wonder if there just needs to be a different approach based upon different parts of the world. This is probably going to sound controversial. If anybody&#8217;s listening to this I&#8217;m just throwing it out there. Given what you&#8217;ve described in Australia, I do wonder if the Australian WordPress community needs a different set of parameters applied for a period of time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Because there are different constraints, there are different problems, than say you might have in Europe. And it might be that one size doesn&#8217;t fit all, and those considerations could be different for Australia. They could be different for, well pick any part of the world, any country. They might to be judged differently. I don&#8217;t know if that would ever happen, but it&#8217;s certainly an interesting idea.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:32:35] <strong>Jo Minney:</strong> Yeah a hundred percent. And if you&#8217;ve got Matt&#8217;s ear, when we do manage to have our first WordCamp again after the pandemic, we&#8217;d love for him to come visit. Maybe that will help get some more people there. So we do want to make it a primarily Australian event with as many Australian speakers as we can get. But I think having the support and the ear of the global WordPress community would be important.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:32:57] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Okay so you&#8217;ve given us one possible way of reinvigorating things. The idea of financial help for, for example, speakers. If there&#8217;s any other ideas you want to just float, go for it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:33:09] <strong>Jo Minney:</strong> Yeah. So I think something that for me is really hopeful and something that I think is amazing, and I&#8217;m really excited about seeing it happen in the near future. And I&#8217;m not sure how much of this I am meant to be talking about but I&#8217;m going to anyway. And that is the idea that we&#8217;re going to have sort of a contributor tab in the latest WordPress release. Sort of about page.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And a little bit more information about that because something that has really been a challenge is that, because again, as you said, you don&#8217;t just bump into other contributors here, you have to actually seek that out. And a lot of people don&#8217;t realize that that is something that they can do. That you don&#8217;t need to be able to code to be a contributor.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I think that the two things go hand in hand. So by contributing to something you&#8217;re feeling like you&#8217;re part of the community and you feel like you&#8217;re not just giving back to it, but also receiving from it, because you get to be a part of that conversation and the direction of where everything is going.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And if we can broaden the people who know about that and make sure that they&#8217;re informed. So your average WordPress user or developer has that information sort of plonked in front of them with, hey, did you know that these are a whole bunch of things that you can do that don&#8217;t require you to be an absolute guru at PHP?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Then I think that that&#8217;s something that&#8217;s going to be really exciting, and hopefully attract more people who historically haven&#8217;t been involved in that community.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:34:36] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Great. Any other suggestions or we can move on?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:34:39] <strong>Jo Minney:</strong> I think they&#8217;re the main ones for me. Just trying to increase the representation in any way that we can. I like the idea of the new WordCamps but I&#8217;m not sure that anything has really come up that is the new format for WordCamps. I&#8217;m not sure that anything has really come up that has sounded like it&#8217;s going to be a super fit for us. So if anyone&#8217;s got ideas we&#8217;d love to hear them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:34:59] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Can we just dwell on that for a minute? So I spoke to Angela Jin who is the Automattician who, broadly speaking, she steers in many ways the different bits and pieces. And one of the things that we talked about on a recent podcast episode was about this new idea of WordCamp&#8217;s having a different flavor. Perhaps more localized, perhaps localized around a specific theme.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So it may be that there would be an SEO one. Or there might be something about blocks. The idea being though that rather than having an event in which everything goes, you would lock it down a little bit and encourage people to attend if they are into that particular niche, if you like. So having looked at those proposals, none of that&#8217;s jumped out. That&#8217;s curious.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:35:46] <strong>Jo Minney:</strong> I think one of the reasons on that for me is that there still seems like there&#8217;s going to be, maybe not 1,200 hours worth of volunteer work, but a significant amount of volunteer work to make it happen. And we&#8217;re struggling to get 20 people at a meetup. So I personally don&#8217;t have the time to put in even 400 hours of volunteer work, or even 50 hours of volunteer work to have eight people show up to an event, and be the only person who is organising and running it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:36:17] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Yeah that does make sense. Obviously you are operating in a completely different system. I think the endeavor of these new WordCamps is to try and shake it up, because I think although the Australian example that you&#8217;ve just described seems to be more severe, I think the feeling has been that over the whole of the international community the numbers have perhaps dwindled a little bit and there are challenges in getting people to come back.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so trying new things out, the hope would be that some of it sticks and some good ideas would rise to the surface. But I do like the fact that you&#8217;re open to new ideas. And it may be that somebody in the next year puts on an event which isn&#8217;t an absolute runaway success. And it&#8217;s just quirky in some way that people like, and you may be able to borrow that example.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:37:06] <strong>Jo Minney:</strong> Yeah absolutely. I think two things that I would love to see happen more of in the community in general is local contributor days. So that&#8217;s something that we&#8217;ve tossed around and we&#8217;re fortunate we do have one full time Automattician that lives in my state.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So he works on Gutenberg, and while he doesn&#8217;t super love public speaking he does get up and do it anyway because he knows that there&#8217;s not really anyone else with the same level of experience and expertise as what he&#8217;s got. So super grateful for that. Tell Dan thank you. But I think having a contributor day locally would be a great way of driving more sort of enthusiasm around the community.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But to do that we need to have enough people that can help run it. And I&#8217;ve never even been to a contributor day myself, so that&#8217;s not something that I really feel comfortable running. And hopefully that will change after WordCamp US. So I will be going to my first contributor day. I&#8217;m super excited about that. So that&#8217;s something that we&#8217;re hoping to do.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And another thing that we actually did in 2020 right before the pandemic hit, that I would encourage any other struggling communities to consider as a way to, I guess reinvigorate, but also bring the community closer together. And again, it&#8217;s a huge amount of work, but it is so rewarding. And that&#8217;s the do_action events. So I&#8217;m not sure if you&#8217;ve heard of these before Nathan.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So we ran a do_action event back in January of 2020, and it was so fun. So much chaos. We built eight charities websites, theoretically in a day. I ended up finishing off most of them over the following six months. But just for the rewarding experience of bringing that community together and seeing a hundred volunteers in a room, trying to use WordPress to help these charities was phenomenal. And I think it&#8217;s probably, when I look at what&#8217;s happening and I&#8217;m like, oh, is it really worth it? I think back to that. And that&#8217;s the thing that keeps me going.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:39:08] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> During the last few years, has the community, I know that the real world events have been on hold, but have you got a thriving online event set up? Are there things that are going on in these cities which are online and regular and what have you? Or is it really just that even the online stuff has gone away as well?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:39:30] <strong>Jo Minney:</strong> Will did run some online stuff. There&#8217;s a two and a half hour difference between Sydney and Perth, so our community didn&#8217;t attend a lot of that stuff, but I know that he did have some good attendance for a while. I think post pandemic, a lot of people got burned out with Zoom. They just didn&#8217;t want to Zoom all the time. And I get that, a hundred percent get that. I&#8217;m on video calls pretty much all day, every day with my clients. And I think it&#8217;s great that this technology opens up so many doors, but I can also understand that it can be exhausting.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In terms of things like Slack, we have really struggled to get our local community to use Slack. We actually have a WP Australia workspace, so that has started to bounce back. But it was essentially dead for a couple of years. And there was basically no conversations happening on there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Locally, what I&#8217;ve found, we tried a bunch of different platforms. People don&#8217;t go to Meetup. We struggle even to get people that come to our meetups to use Meetup. So, the one that we&#8217;ve had the most success with, which is, sucks for me because I don&#8217;t use it, is Facebook. So we&#8217;ve actually got a local community group on Facebook, and I log in like once or twice a week to check for comments on there, and that&#8217;s the only time I use Facebook, so if that&#8217;s where people are, then that&#8217;s where I&#8217;ll go to try and get them along. But yeah, online not great either, so.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:40:58] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Well, I think probably we&#8217;re just approaching the amount of time that we&#8217;ve got. So I will just ask that if anybody is listening to this who feels that they could help, obviously if you&#8217;re in Australia, that would be, I guess, an added bonus. But you know, even if not, if there&#8217;s some way that you feel that you could help. Jo, where would we contact you? Is there an email address or a social handle that you use?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:41:24] <strong>Jo Minney:</strong> I&#8217;m Jo Minney on most socials. I am recently on Mastodon, because I got mad at it being rebranded on the bird, that&#8217;s no longer a bird. And if people want to email me all of my stuff, all of my contact details are on my website. So jominney.com is my personal blog, and always happy to have a chat.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:41:45] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Jo Minney, I really appreciate you chatting to me today about the state of the WordPress community in Australia. Thank you so much.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:41:52] <strong>Jo Minney:</strong> Thanks Nathan. It&#8217;s been very fun.</p>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<p>On the podcast today we have <a href=\"https://jominney.com/\">Jo Minney</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Jo is the founder of a small business that specialises in building websites for organisations, mainly nonprofits and the tech industry. With a background in engineering, Jo decided to shift her focus to website development using WordPress. She was excited about the WordPress community, and joined her local meetup, eventually becoming an organiser. Jo is keen for the WordPress community in Australia to grow, and has been making significant contributions to that growth.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In this episode, Jo shares her insights on the challenges of organising WordCamps and meetups in Australia, where the large size of the country and small population present some unique obstacles. If you’re used to a European or North American setting, it’s really interesting how the geography of the country presents challenges not seen elsewhere.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We discuss the importance of paying speakers and covering their travel expenses to create equal opportunities for freelancers and small businesses, as well as to give the Australian community a stronger voice.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We talk about her journey with WordPress, starting from her early days as a coder in a different field, and navigating the community online. Jo highlights the need for in-person opportunities to learn and connect with others, especially in a global community where time zone differences and online platforms can be limiting.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We chat about the challenges faced by the Australian WordPress community, from limited resources and burnout, to the struggle of attracting new organisers and attendees. Jo shares some exciting success stories, such as organising WordPress events and hosting a successful do_action event.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We briefly get into the need for more diverse voices, and the importance of fostering a supportive and inclusive environment</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you’re interested in hearing about how the WordPress community is doing in Australia, this episode is for you.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Useful links.</h2>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.meetup.com/en-AU/WordPress-Perth/\">WordPress Perth Meetup</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://wpaustralia.org/events/\">WP Australia website</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://brisbane.wordcamp.org/2019/\">WordCamp Brisbane</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://asia.wordcamp.org/2023/\">WordCamp Asia</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://doaction.org/\">do_action events</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://wpaustralia.slack.com/join/shared_invite/enQtMzMyNzI5NTcyMTY1LWY5NGEwYjAxODExMDY4Y2IxOWRiZTQxZWQzMmI4YjE0NDkzZDU4MjYzODMxYzVmZGJhNzdlZWM1YzRjNWNhYmU#/shared-invite/email\">WP Australia Slack</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/wpaustralia/\">WP Australia on Facebook</a></p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 23 Aug 2023 14:00:00 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:14:\"Nathan Wrigley\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:25;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:33:\"HeroPress: From WordPress To Emma\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:56:\"https://heropress.com/?post_type=heropress-essays&p=5766\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:118:\"https://heropress.com/essays/from-wordpress-to-emma/#utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=from-wordpress-to-emma\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:10005:\"<img width=\"1024\" height=\"512\" src=\"https://heropress.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/082323-min.jpg\" class=\"attachment-large size-large wp-post-image\" alt=\"Pull Quote: WordPress taught me to write, it taught me to code, it taught me to express myself.\" />\nHere is Emma reading her own story aloud.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-pre-emma-nbsp\">Pre Emma&nbsp;</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>My parents are both into tech. My dad &#8211; a Computer Engineer, and my mum &#8211; a Semiconductor Engineer, met in the ’80s in Silicon Valley. The romance that started between them eventually led to me, a techy kid who loved doodling on the walls just as much as building computers with her dad.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-kid-emma\">Kid Emma</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>I can remember Y2K, the Covid of its time in the tech world. My dad and his colleagues were at all the server rooms “just in case”, and we celebrated at a Korean Baptist Church “just in case.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I remember the first AOL trial CD &#8211; with 30 whole minutes of “FREE” internet, my first IM (instant messenger) username (snugglebunny &#8211; I know, I know), free calls after 9 pm, and putting the phone to your ear only to hear a blasting of eeee-oahhh–eeee–uuuuu that told you the internet was on.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I also remember when our one family computer turned into three personal ones—no more having to wait your turn. Technology was changing. </p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\">\n<p>Now you could use your home phone and the internet at the same time, and videos went from a 2-day loading speed to 2 hours. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>By the time I was in university, we all had the internet in our pockets. I had a laptop that was way too heavy for its size, BUT my dad&#8217;s work computer screen still looked like the matrix.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-uni-emma-nbsp\">Uni Emma&nbsp;</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>My first WordPress interaction happened when I was in university studying Marketing and Strategic Communications. I started a blog about working as a barista for Starbucks. I was learning HTML5/CSS (yeah, way back then), practicing the basics of the technical side but also enjoying the creativity of designing what my “readers” would see, such as fonts, colors, and layout. I was really putting my newfound knowledge to the test. </p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\">\n<p>I didn’t know it just yet, but I was starting to connect my love for creativity with the tech world.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>The days were filled with tweaking code, and the nights were filled with stories. Stories of customers, fellow baristas, and observations watched from afar. The regulars, the missed connections, the extraordinary amount of times someone missed the toilet when they were trying to poo. But that didn’t last long; I got my degree, and life went forward, but my blog stayed behind.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-twenties-emma-nbsp\">Twenties Emma&nbsp;</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The next time WP made an appearance in my journey was when I started a blog about being a teacher in South Korea. Stories of coffee as the common denominator turned into the tall tales of a not-so-Korean Korean living in a world that she didn’t know much about. The students and teaching were one thing; the community of expats was quite another. Spending time with such a varied group of weirdos was how I realized there is more to life than a 9 to 5. We shared our stories about how we each got there. </p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\">\n<p>Ex-military, farmers, film-extras, photographers, journalists, developers, semi-pro footballers, each sharing where they were from and how they got to where they are now.&nbsp; </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>With each closed door, another opens, and sometimes more doors than you can imagine. My blog didn’t last long. But the way of life (traveling and meeting interesting strangers) has lasted till now.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-present-emma\">Present Emma</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Fast forward to now-ish.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I’m the Head of Content at Hostinger.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I decided to return to school for Computer Engineering and Cyber Security, so I moved to Lithuania. The goal was to get another degree and a visa to the EU, but instead, I found Hostinger, the perfect sweet spot for tech + marketing. Fast forward through COVID, through my graduation, and re-enter WordPress. I didn’t actually think “work” could get much better until the WP Community was introduced into my life. </p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\">\n<p>I found out then that all those things my dad used to say about “finding a job that doesn’t feel like work” are actually true.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>I’m talking about waking up excited to see what work throws at you, what fires you can put out, what changes you can implement. What can you do today that can make it better than yesterday? That’s when work doesn’t feel like work. That’s when you know you’ve got it good.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Anyways,&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I joined the WP Slack community, where I was amazed by the number of people, the friendliness, and the amount of information. I had major FOMO for not having had this as a constant in my life until now.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Enter a new team: Documentation. Now <em>they</em> had their priorities straight. Documentation, words, content, and CONSISTENCY– who knew there was a world of Emma’s out there? Not to mention, it was a collective group of people who were there because they wanted to be there, not because they were told. We all had a common goal. Content may be King, but Consistency is Queen.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Then came WordCamp Asia 2023. Hellooo, Korean baby Jesus! It was like being thrown into a sea of open doors. Everyone was kind, welcoming, intelligent, silly, happy, joyful… insert 1000 more adjectives here. AND the best part is, everyone is a WordPress nerd and loves to just talk about WP. Was I in WP heaven? </p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\">\n<p>I found a place where I could be unapologetically me. Genuine Emma. Not one of the many Emma’s in the world, but this Emma. Me.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Since then, even more doors have opened. I volunteered as an MC. I wanted to see if I could make these stage fright butterflies into something more. I’ve spoken at events and presented at work, but WordCamp was a whole other level. The acceptance, the kudos, and the ease of knowing that everyone was rooting for me to succeed was a breath of fresh air. I took these teachings, experiences, and skils back to Hostinger and it changed the way I led my team and looked at projects, issues, etc.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So here we are. Volunteering for my 3rd flagship, looking back at my life full of twists and turns with WordPress as my mile markers. I didn’t always realize that it has been a constant in my life. It taught me to write, it taught me to code, it taught me to express myself. It taught me that everyone has a place in WP and all are welcome.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-bonus-nbsp\">Bonus:&nbsp;</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>While revisiting my WordPress journey, I stumbled upon an old post; even though I had to make a few updates to it, it’s a nice TL;DR.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-poet-emma\">Poet Emma</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>There once was a girl<br />Who had more than a skip-and-hop in her step<br />Dancing along a string of lights</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One day she noticed &#8211; in the sea of her peers<br />To the left were wide eyes and skin as pure as snow<br />To the right was darker skin and hair long, silky, with flow</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Her eyes were not as blue as the 7 seas and crystal waters<br />Her eyes were not brown tree rings filled with stories passed down and reincarnated&nbsp;<br />Her eyes told a different story<br />From her white ancestors– a victory ring protecting what was to come&nbsp;<br />With a starburst of wildflowers shining through the heart&nbsp;<br />With speckles of green, and blue, and brown<br />She had a little bit of everyone<br />But it didn&#8217;t turn her frown upside down&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Some of her friends turned red like a tomato<br />Under the hot desert sun<br />While others began to glow a beautiful brown<br />But hid in the shadows till it was gone<br />Her skin did a combo<br />Not red nor brown,&nbsp;<br />Olivey yellow<br />And added a milky way of stars dusted across her nose&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Her friends packed brown paper bags and Superman lunch boxes&nbsp;<br />Filled with tortillas or crustless sandwiches<br />Hers had rice, kim, and a yogortut<br />No one wanted to trade&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Straight A’s were a must!<br />If not, you were grounded<br />She thought this was the same for all the kids<br />But she was wrong&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Fast forward 20 years<br />Her eyes have seen the world&nbsp;<br />Dipped her toes in the 5000 islands<br />Scaled waterfalls after riding her bike up a mountain&nbsp;<br />Jumped from a plane over sand, water, and snow<br />Tickled her taste buds from bugs to Van Gogh&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Her eyes have not changed<br />But other have<br />She no longer is the girl who gets the question, why are her eyes like that?<br />But she is now the girl who gets the question, how do I get eyes like that?&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>She no longer longs for her freckles to be gone<br />But now appreciates them as they come, and miss them when they&#8217;re gone<br />She no longer wonders why studying was an important loop<br />But now she is always ahead and has a stronger work ethic</p>\n\n\n\n<p>She still wonders<br />She still looks with her eyes<br />The same eyes that were once filled with confusion and doubt<br />But now her eyes embrace it&nbsp;<br />And are ready for the next route</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://heropress.com/essays/from-wordpress-to-emma/\">From WordPress To Emma</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://heropress.com\">HeroPress</a>.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 23 Aug 2023 12:07:14 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:10:\"Emma Young\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:26;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:23:\"Matt: I Love WordCamps!\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:22:\"https://ma.tt/?p=95743\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:39:\"https://ma.tt/2023/08/i-love-wordcamps/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:5867:\"<p>One of the cooler things the WordPress community started doing <a href=\"https://sf.wordcamp.org/2006/\">in 2006</a> was putting on these events we called WordCamps. <a href=\"https://us.wordcamp.org/2023/\">A big one is about to kick off in National Harbor, Maryland</a> (which is basically Washington DC, but we&#8217;re calling it National Harbor for some reason).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You might be wondering where the name came from: Tim O&#8217;Reilly, of the <a href=\"https://www.oreilly.com/\">O&#8217;Reilly books</a> that so many of us learned from, hosted a hacker event called <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foo_Camp\">Foo Camp</a> but it had limited capacity, and was therefore something of an exclusive invite (one time I eventually went I slept in a sleeping bag in an office).  <a href=\"https://tantek.com/\">Tantek Çelik</a> had been invited the year before, but not in 2005, and I had never been invited, so a group of us put together a more &#8220;open source&#8221; event in response called <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BarCamp\">BarCamp</a>. (The name was an allusion to the foo/bar concept in teaching programming, and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BarCamp#/media/File:BarCamp_originators.jpg\">the picture</a> on that Wikipedia page was in the living room of my first apartment in San Francisco, as you can tell by the stand-up piano and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_Fp4znXvOg\">Thelonious Monk</a> poster.)</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Foo had the idea of a conference created on-the-fly by its organizers, and also had a radical event where there wasn&#8217;t even lodging but all that mattered was getting people together. Bar took that format and opened up the invite list, and did it quickly with just a few weeks of planning. They also open sourced the format so BarCamps could be hosted anywhere in the world, and many were. The following year I riffed on that and made the <a href=\"https://sf.wordcamp.org/2006/\">first WordCamp in San Francisco</a>, at the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cafe_Du_Nord\">Swedish American Music Hall</a>, the <a href=\"https://www.weareasgods.film/\">same place Stewart Brand hosted the first hackers conference in the 70s</a>. (We didn&#8217;t know that at the time, it was just a coincidence.)</p>\n\n\n\n<p>WordCamp took the everyone-is-welcome from Bar, mixed it with the attendees-create-the-conference from Foo, added a little more structure and planning so we ended up with these <a href=\"https://central.wordcamp.org/\">really groovy community-organized events all over the world</a> where people come together to learn, contribute, get to know each other, and have fun. WordCamp San Francisco evolved into <a href=\"https://us.wordcamp.org/\">WordCamp US</a>, our flagpole event for North America. (I like that US can mean &#8220;us&#8221; as well as United States.) There have been hundreds of WordCamps around the world, and when we were getting started I used to go to all of them; if someone put one together I&#8217;d cram into an economy seat and fly there. I can&#8217;t make it to all of them anymore, but I still go as many as I can, and they&#8217;re some of my favorite days of the entire year.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s so cool to see a group of people from the eclectic backgrounds come together because we love making the thing that allows people to make the thing. (WordPress.) You&#8217;ll see CEOs of multi-hundred million ARR companies brushing shoulders with techno-anarchists, all brought together by a common hope and belief in the <a href=\"https://ma.tt/2014/01/four-freedoms/\">four freedoms of open source</a> and the mission of WordPress—to democratize publishing, put the best tools in the world in the hands of everyone, for free and for freedom.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This year&#8217;s WordCamp US is exciting to me for a bunch of reasons. One, I love spending time with other contributors to open source. Second, WordCamp organizers iterate and learn, and so every year I&#8217;m excited to see what&#8217;s being trialed and what&#8217;s improved, because they just keep getting better and better. Third, we&#8217;re doing a community summit beforehand for the first time in a while, which is why I&#8217;m already in Maryland. Finally, on the <a href=\"https://communitysummit.wordcamp.org/2023/schedule/\">amazing schedule</a> are two speakers I&#8217;ve invited to bring something new to our milieu.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://kenliu.name/\">Ken Liu</a> is one of my favorite sci-fi writers and will be giving an amazing talk weaving together the history of narrative craft and modern publishing and technology. I&#8217;ve read almost everything he&#8217;s written or translated, and seen him talk once before, and couldn&#8217;t be more curious to hear what he&#8217;s bringing to the WordPress community.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/\">Simon Willison</a> is an engineer and blogger I&#8217;ve followed since the earliest days of WordPress, and recently he&#8217;s been one of the most interesting explorers in the new world of <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/tags/llms/\">AI and LLMs</a>. He&#8217;ll be sharing with us how to tap into this new alien intelligence, how it can accelerate our coding, security, and mission to democratize publishing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So if you ever have a chance to go to a WordCamp, take it! It may be too late for this one, but you can follow the livestream (visit <a href=\"https://us.wordcamp.org/2023/\">the site</a> once the conference starts), and plan for next year. We also make sure all the talks accessible <a href=\"https://wordpress.tv/\">on WordPress.tv</a> later.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Foo Camps still happen, by the way, and have branched into science and such, and who gets invited is a whole deal. They&#8217;re still awesome.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I hope what people see here is that creativity and doing generates more creativity and doing.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Tue, 22 Aug 2023 23:30:18 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:4:\"Matt\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:27;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:139:\"WPTavern: WordPress Coding Standards Maintainer Warns Maintenance Will Be Halted Without Funding: “This Is an Unsustainable Situation.”\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:30:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=148049\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:142:\"https://wptavern.com/wordpress-coding-standards-maintainer-warns-maintenance-will-be-halted-without-funding-this-is-an-unsustainable-situation\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:4425:\"<p><a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/WordPress-Coding-Standards/releases/tag/3.0.0\">WordPressCS 3.0.0</a> was <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2023/08/21/wordpresscs-3-0-0-is-now-available/\">released</a> this week with what its maintainer, Juliette Reinders Folmer, says are significant changes to improve the accuracy, performance, stability, and maintainability of all sniffs, and its handling of modern PHP. The project is a collection of <a href=\"https://github.com/squizlabs/PHP_CodeSniffer\">PHP_CodeSniffer</a> rules (sniffs) that are used to validate code developed for WordPress, helping developers meet the requirements of the official <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/handbook/best-practices/coding-standards/\">WordPress Coding Standards</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This update adds many of the non-controversial rules <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2020/03/20/updating-the-coding-standards-for-modern-php/\">proposed in March 2020</a> to the Coding standards guidelines but leaves those that generated more discussion or objections for a future release. Many of the new rules are now available as sniffs in WordPressCS.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Version 3.0.0 includes important architecture changes. Most notably, Composer is now the only supported way to install WordPressCS, as this update includes four run-time dependencies. The release contains breaking changes for those using ignore annotations and those who maintain custom rulesets or have created a custom PHPCS standard based on the project. A <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/WordPress-Coding-Standards/wiki/Upgrade-Guide-to-WordPressCS-3.0.0-for-Developers-of-external-standards\">detailed upgrade guide</a> is available for these various scenarios.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPressCS is largely maintained by Folmer and a small group of volunteers, but the future of the project is in jeopardy if they cannot get funding. Folmer said it is currently in a good place with this release but this will not last long with the pace at which PHP is moving.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;WordPressCS 3.0.0 has cost thousands of hours of work and the vast majority of work has been done by one, mostly unpaid, contributor, with code review support from two fellow maintainers,&#8221; she said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Unless funding is found to continue maintaining WordPressCS and its dependencies, the future is bleak and maintenance will be halted.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Folmer is calling on corporation and agency users of WordPressCS to find a way to fund the project&#8217;s continued maintenance and development. She elaborated on the dire need to have more contributors involved:</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\">\n<p>If we are being realistic, the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bus_factor\">bus factor</a>&nbsp;of WordPressCS is&nbsp;<strong>1</strong>, which is the most dangerous situation for any project to be in.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A large part of the WordPress community, including WordPress Core, relies heavily on the WordPress Coding Standards for code quality and security checks and while the community has been pretty vocal with copious complaints about the delayed release, barely anyone has stepped up and actually contributed.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The majority of the work for WordPressCS requires specialized knowledge. Knowledge which can be learned with enough time investment, but in recent years nobody has stepped up to do so.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><em>This is an unsustainable situation and it ends now</em></strong>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPressCS has become one of the most highly used open source tools in the WordPress ecosystem that is now in a vulnerable place with so few contributors. Although many developers commented on the release, thanking Folmer for her efforts, no contributors or corporations have publicly stepped forward to support the project&#8217;s continued develpment.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;With over 15 million installations on Packagist and a 400% increase in monthly installation in the past three years alone, WPCS’s popularity is surging and shows no sign of stopping,&#8221; Lucas Bustamante, a backend developer specialized in automated tests, commented on the post. &#8220;The situation is alarming as WPCS is a foundational tool that flags not only code style issues but also critical security issues, making WordPress a more secure CMS. Letting WPCS fall into limbo poses a risk to the entire WordPress ecosystem.&#8221;</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Tue, 22 Aug 2023 20:55:56 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:28;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:78:\"Do The Woo Community: All About the Page Builder Summit with Anchen and Nathan\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:28:\"https://dothewoo.io/?p=76079\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:77:\"https://dothewoo.io/all-about-the-page-builder-summit-with-anchen-and-nathan/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:434:\"<p>We chat about the Page Builder Summit, how it started, what it takes to run the summit and what you can expect in September.</p>\n<p>&gt;&gt; The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://dothewoo.io/all-about-the-page-builder-summit-with-anchen-and-nathan/\">All About the Page Builder Summit with Anchen and Nathan</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://dothewoo.io\">Do the Woo - a WooCommerce Builder Community</a>	.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Tue, 22 Aug 2023 08:07:00 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:5:\"BobWP\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:29;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:107:\"WPTavern: New Chrome Browser Extension Enables One-Click Plugin and Theme Testing with WordPress Playground\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:30:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=147997\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:118:\"https://wptavern.com/new-chrome-browser-extension-enables-one-click-plugin-and-theme-testing-with-wordpress-playground\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:4052:\"<p><a href=\"https://developer.wordpress.org/playground/\">WordPress Playground</a>, an experimental project that uses WebAssembly (WASM) to&nbsp;<a href=\"https://wptavern.com/new-prototype-runs-wordpress-in-the-browser-with-no-php-server\">run WordPress in the browser</a>,&nbsp;makes it possible for users to quickly test plugins and themes without having to set up a local development environment.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ordinarily, testing a plugin or theme with Playground requires visiting&nbsp;<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://playground.wordpress.net/\" target=\"_blank\"><code>playground.wordpress.net</code></a>, which will&nbsp;instantly create a real WordPress instance with admin access without having to install PHP, MySQL, or Apache. It runs inside the browser using a SQLite database. Adding a plugin or theme to the instance is as easy as appending the slug to the URL when creating the test site: </p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://playground.wordpress.net/?plugin=gutenberg\">https://playground.wordpress.net/?plugin=gutenberg</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://playground.wordpress.net/?theme=lemmony-agency\">https://playground.wordpress.net/?theme=lemmony-agency</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p>A new Chrome browser extension, created by LUBUS, a development agency, makes this even easier by adding a &#8220;Playground&#8221; button to theme and plugin pages on WordPress.org. Users can fire up a sandbox instance to test drive a theme or plugin in just one click. </p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<img width=\"1470\" height=\"853\" src=\"https://149611589.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/wordpress-playground-browser-extension-lubus.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-148029\" />\n\n\n\n<p>I tested the extension and it works as advertised. It&#8217;s a neat little shortcut for launching a Playground instance without having to remember the URL or get the plugin/theme&#8217;s slug to append to it. The video below shows a site created with a selected plugin installed in under 20 seconds.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;We have been using Playground internally a lot for testing out plugins, and quick demos for internal or client meetings,&#8221; LUBUS founder Ajit Bohra said. &#8220;We often find a plugin or theme which we would like to test drive. It involves copying the slug of the theme or plugin and using them in the URL. To make this quick we thought of building and quick browser extension to add a button on wordpress.org to quickly launch a plugin or theme in the Playground.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bohra posted his process of creating the extension in a <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ajitbohra/status/1692408702962393256\">thread</a> on X. He used the <a href=\"https://www.plasmo.com/\">Plasmo framework</a>, which offers a dedicated runtime for building browser extensions, taking the project from idea to built in approximately 30 minutes.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">For POC code wise all we need to get the required button on the plugin page. <a href=\"https://t.co/2lEV2H4q0K\">pic.twitter.com/2lEV2H4q0K</a></p>&mdash; Ajit Bohra (@ajitbohra) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ajitbohra/status/1692415787791958085?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">August 18, 2023</a></blockquote>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<p>Bohra said the browser extension is currently a proof of concept that he would like to further extend with more settings based on feedback from users. He also hopes to collaborate with the Meta team in the future to see something like this added to the plugin and theme pages on WordPress.org so that users don&#8217;t have to rely on a browser extension.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Chrome extension is called &#8220;<a href=\"https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/open-in-wordpress-playgro/khfpfafeepbfdhggfoalfmbhkmjkolmo/related\">Open in WordPress Playground</a>&#8221; and is available to the public for free on the Chrome Web Store.

Welcome back to Post Status Draft. I&#8217;ve got a special guest today and I&#8217;m excited because I&#8217;ve worked with this awesome person professional for I think it&#8217;s been five years now. Four years? No, probably four and a half years now, Kelly. And. So back when I had just sold items, I was working the, you know, my job at trying to transition team, get some things done in the year after we had sold and I was starting to percolate. Okay, I&#8217;ve got this huge career change coming up, this huge business, whatever change in my professional life. And I sought out a coach and found Kelly Gallagher. So she&#8217;s my professional coach for four and a half years. We&#8217;re going to have a great conversation talking about coaching times when it&#8217;s so helpful to have a coach. And I&#8217;ll share personal experiences, too, but you&#8217;re in for a treat today. So Kelly, thanks so much for being on the podcast.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Kelly Gallagher (00:01:02) &#8211; Thank you for having me. I&#8217;ve been watching some of your podcasts, and I&#8217;m just honored to be the subject of one of them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Kelly Gallagher (00:01:07) &#8211; So thank you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cory Miller (00:01:09) &#8211; I often refer to Kelly as my secret weapon because a lot of the big things that have happened in the last five years, for sure in my life I&#8217;ve rehearsed, practiced, talked through all of these with Kelly. So, Kelly, tell us a little bit about your background.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Kelly Gallagher (00:01:25) &#8211; Um, Cory, I came from a business development specialty within corporate America, specifically pharmaceuticals and the medical industry, and also diagnostics and lab testing. So I was a road warrior. I was out closing deals and my responsibilities escalated and escalated to the point where. Um, the last ten years, I was with a diagnostic lab, and I was also training other salespeople. I was interviewing them, hiring them and then coaching them. But I didn&#8217;t know I was coaching because I wasn&#8217;t sure even what coaching was. I wanted to take over the training department. So I was told, Well, you have no experience, even though I was already doing it. So I challenged and said I would like to go back and get my masters.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Kelly Gallagher (00:02:16) &#8211; And I entered the coaching program, which is a just gold standard industry. I don&#8217;t know. It turned out to be one of the best. And so I entered that. And then while I was doing it, I thought, why not just get a master&#8217;s in business administration? Because I already know these things. So I went to school for five years and it was the best five years of my life. Um, I learned that I love to learn, and I think that may be what separates good coaches from great coaches. Is that. Constant wanting to move the bar up, that constant going to class mentality to be at another level. And that&#8217;s what&#8217;s really defined my career. There&#8217;s not really a time of the year when I&#8217;m not in continuing education and it&#8217;s my passion. I just want to be a master of my craft. So that was my journey. The interesting sidebar is I was told you can do all this, but if your sales performance drops, we&#8217;re done. We&#8217;re not paying. I said, okay.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Kelly Gallagher (00:03:29) &#8211; But the more I studied coaching and communications, the higher myself through. And there&#8217;s actually a correlation between the two. It doesn&#8217;t seem like there would be, but I learned how to really listen. I was a good listener to begin with, but I became just a great listener and observer of behavior. And I also learned how to challenge people. So if a buyer told me, yes, yes, I&#8217;m definitely going to get the contract signed. And I sensed a hesitancy, I would call them out and go, you know, you&#8217;re sending one thing, but I&#8217;m hearing something else. It sounds like you&#8217;re still uneasy. And a lot of times by doing that, I could tease out that they weren&#8217;t going to buy it and we can have further discussion. So the coaching actually when I finished up. My sales career. It was as far as I could take it, but I owe it all to the coaching training.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cory Miller (00:04:32) &#8211; That&#8217;s awesome. Now, I know you have ICF credentials and all that and you can share a little bit about what ICF is, but so I know you are very involved there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cory Miller (00:04:45) &#8211; Have done there&#8217;s so many regular like you said, I do a lot of work with mental health practitioners and there&#8217;s such a very, I would say regulated, but no like very intense and purposeful way to do therapy. A lot of guidelines, a lot of regulations, a lot of licensure things, ethical consideration, continuing. Ed But coaching has so much of that too. And that&#8217;s where ICF comes into yes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Kelly Gallagher (00:05:12) &#8211; And unfortunately, there&#8217;s not a specific license. I wish there was, but because there isn&#8217;t, the consumer has to really be discerning. And one way to start is that ICF because it&#8217;s the gold standard and for coach is not doing continuing education and involved with ICF. I don&#8217;t know. Chances are there will be less rigor to what they&#8217;re going to be able to do. It&#8217;s not that they wouldn&#8217;t be good coaches.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cory Miller (00:05:40) &#8211; Yeah, I think the ICF stuff is strong. Sometimes I feel like it&#8217;s a little bit too limiting, but I go, Gosh, it&#8217;s so good because it&#8217;s trying to really professionalize the coaching industry where anybody can just say, Oh, I&#8217;m my coach, I&#8217;m a life coach, whatever it is.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Kelly Gallagher (00:05:57) &#8211; People just hang out a shingle and say, Boom, magic, I&#8217;m a coach. I two think it can be limiting, but I offer a bit of a hybrid because I have so much business experience. I&#8217;ll often tell my clients, Hey, I&#8217;m going to shift out of coaching if you want. Is it okay if I put on my business act and they almost never had anyone say no in interviews? And so then I&#8217;m able to interject a little, you know what this happened to blah, blah, blah. And I think that&#8217;s what differentiates me from other coaches. But the ICF standards are just critical. And the other thing about the ICF is you have to have 250 hours of continuing education to keep getting the licensure. That&#8217;s not a license to keep, you know, being indoors. And so that really raises the bar and enables the coach to really grow because you&#8217;re constantly taking a course. Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cory Miller (00:07:02) &#8211; So super, super strong. By the way, if you&#8217;re listening, you want to look if the coach has ICF certifications and all that, that&#8217;s really important, rigorous, rigorous work that they do to keep that up means to me it goes through taking it very seriously their profession.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cory Miller (00:07:19) &#8211; So Kelly, what is a coach? We&#8217;re going to spend some time talking about the times in which coach has been so, so valuable to your clients, to me, and we&#8217;re going to share experiences around that. But first, I kind of want to get a baseline of like, what is a coach?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Kelly Gallagher (00:07:38) &#8211; Great question. Mean a coach. I had this conversation this morning at the pool at 5 a.m. Someone said, Oh, you&#8217;re going to coach. They just want content. I said, No, that&#8217;s not really what coaching is. I&#8217;m not really delivering content. I think a coach is someone that walks on a journey with a professional who wants to raise the bar. Um, it can be a life coach too. So then you&#8217;re walking the journey with an individual who has an area of life where they want to improve or progress. And that&#8217;s still the same formula for going through the coaching process, whether it be an executive or whether it be. Someone who wants to increase communication with their husband or wife.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cory Miller (00:08:25) &#8211; So, yeah. And part of how we were working together when we first started working together was I was going to the same school you went to, which is fantastic. University of Texas and Dallas and their coaching program is incredible. And being mentored by you. And because I was getting asked when when I left our teams and I was trying to do my own thing, I thought, okay, it&#8217;s going to be coaching People go, What is it, Coach? What do you do? And I was like, Oh gosh, I&#8217;m struggling with these. But it&#8217;s so much that it&#8217;s that walking alongside a person on a journey and I like what you added to it, is like they want to raise the bar, they want to do something more. And, you know, I have so much reflected about my business entrepreneurial career for the last 15 years ago. If I had a coach from the beginning, it would have been so much better in many ways. Not just success, success for sure, but also health clarity.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Kelly Gallagher (00:09:23) &#8211; It&#8217;s funny you say that, Cory, because even 20 years ago when I was in pharmaceuticals and I was doing very well, had I had a coach, I would have been a rock star because there were rough edges that I couldn&#8217;t see. You can&#8217;t see them in yourselves the way someone else can who&#8217;s actively listening to you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cory Miller (00:09:43) &#8211; Yeah. Well, and you know, the parallel we always give is sports. You know the best. Greatest of all time. Athletes have coaches and have people around them. Like you just assume they wake up and they&#8217;re just as good naturally. No, they work on their craft. And I think about that so much. Like, I know you work with a lot of high achievers and oftentimes so many of the entrepreneurs I&#8217;ve worked with very high achievers too. I&#8217;ve had the pleasure of having people on my team big time, high achievers. And you just go, like, if you really want to do well in what you&#8217;re doing, you need to have somebody that&#8217;s on your side.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cory Miller (00:10:23) &#8211; Nobody does it alone. I think that&#8217;s the fast that we perpetuate in our culture and especially in business, like with entrepreneurs, is like, Oh, I&#8217;m the rockstar. I do this by myself, that you got these icons out there. You know, Steve Jobs is the one you hear over and over and over 100,000 times. You go, He didn&#8217;t do it alone. No, there&#8217;s no way you can do it alone. And having someone in your corner that&#8217;s helping you perform at the highest level is so critical.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Kelly Gallagher (00:10:54) &#8211; Yes, I agree. And, you know, oftentimes people will also say, well, isn&#8217;t it like therapy? I would call it therapy. Ten x. Because therapy&#8217;s great and I think everyone should go through that process at some time in their life. I really believe in it. But at some point it&#8217;s limited because it&#8217;s just keeps moving into the past and feelings and often sad feelings. Whereas coaches moving the person forward so high achievers get bored in therapy after a while, after a while, and they might go back and forth to therapy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Kelly Gallagher (00:11:34) &#8211; But generally they find that coaching helps them because it&#8217;s goal oriented.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cory Miller (00:11:39) &#8211; Yeah, well, and I know there&#8217;s a big distinction between therapy and coaching and really, you know, really try to their distinct things. And oftentimes probably you have taught this mentioned like therapy is looking back, coaching is looking forward. Is that how you kind of see that?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Kelly Gallagher (00:11:56) &#8211; Yes. And you know, as a coach and a credentialed coach, I&#8217;m ethically bound if I feel like someone continually goes into therapy. Waters and themes, um, I&#8217;m bound to refer them on to therapists till they are more stabilized. And then oftentimes a lot of my clients are in therapy and coaching together. They really work well hand in hand.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cory Miller (00:12:22) &#8211; Yes. In fact, for the bulk of the time right now, I am not currently seeing a counselor, however, for the last see two months, but for the bulk of the time we&#8217;ve worked together have had a counselor and a coach. So I think their yin yang, their.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Kelly Gallagher (00:12:41) &#8211; Right. And the people that come to me and have had some therapy, even if it was limited, they have just a little bit more self awareness.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Kelly Gallagher (00:12:49) &#8211; So coaching progresses faster.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cory Miller (00:12:52) &#8211; Yeah. If you&#8217;re doing your work to.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Kelly Gallagher (00:12:55) &#8211; Because other otherwise get clients. Sometimes we&#8217;ll say, Well, what does it matter how I&#8217;m feeling about this? Well, it matters a lot because, you know, your heart is just as involved in these decisions and actions and creative things you&#8217;re asking yourself to do as the frontal lobe of your brain. So they are connected.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cory Miller (00:13:14) &#8211; Yeah. Okay. So we talked about what coaching is a little bit we talked about the distinctions, therapy versus coaching and how they&#8217;re additive and can exist together. And in fact, or even better sometimes, oftentimes, especially in my experience, I would say. Well, I&#8217;m curious, Kelly So I know my own personal experience is related to our coaching professional relationship. But I&#8217;m curious, what are the times you you see people getting into the meat of this kind of conversation between us is like, what are those times when people go, okay, they&#8217;re thrust out to go actively look for a coach and end up, you know, in a in a room or a meeting with you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Kelly Gallagher (00:13:55) &#8211; I would say that generally there&#8217;s some type of struggle. It can be a conflict at work. That&#8217;s a huge one because that dips into, well, do I want a career change? And sometimes people come and they don&#8217;t know what they want. They&#8217;re just not happy. Um, people who want to progress with that and find meaning and integrate what they&#8217;re learning about themselves will come to coaching because that process. It really it&#8217;s like turbocharging the job search and turbocharging people to take interviews and move on and move up without really any kind of formal instruction to just that self-awareness that it builds. So that&#8217;s one of the big ones. Um.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cory Miller (00:14:44) &#8211; Let&#8217;s talk about struggle for a second. So struggle back to that. So is that so you mentioned a couple of factors there. I want to hit both sides. One is maybe I need to make a change, like move out of what I&#8217;m doing. But there&#8217;s another one, which is maybe I want to get promoted or have been promoted or, you know, within an organization to and I&#8217;m curious your experiences around around that too.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cory Miller (00:15:10) &#8211; So I like that it starts with like there&#8217;s some kind of struggle and they&#8217;re seeking outside perspective and help support with that. But it starts with some things they&#8217;re trying to change and wrestling against. Sounds like.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Kelly Gallagher (00:15:24) &#8211; Right? And many times, you know, when you&#8217;re in a new position or you&#8217;re in a position where you are striving to do something else within that company, you will conform to their expectations and almost wear a mask. The to the degree that you lose something in the translation because then you&#8217;re not really connecting with your creative side or your problem solving side or your heart. And so a lot of work can be done to find that balance for people. The other thing that touches on is fear of failure. Your fear of failure is. It&#8217;s just a sweet spot because so many. Points of wanting to change. If we whittle down and we go with the client, what&#8217;s beneath that? What&#8217;s beneath that or what&#8217;s beneath that? And we get down to the core or the middle of the onion. It&#8217;s fear of failure.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Kelly Gallagher (00:16:19) &#8211; And that&#8217;s that&#8217;s just a part of being human. No one wants to humiliate themselves or fall down. But I think, too, in our society, think about schools nowadays. Everyone&#8217;s given a trophy. Soccer, Everyone&#8217;s campaigning, trophy swimming. Everyone makes the team. No one&#8217;s not on the team. Great. So children are raised to not really fail or understand that they founded something and think in a way, I like the philosophy, but in a way I think I see a lot of young adults who come out into the world and they are terrified of not getting a trophy of not. And the reality is, in real life, you don&#8217;t get that many trophies.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cory Miller (00:17:06) &#8211; Yep. Well, we that was that fear of failure thing. We, we talked our last coaching session about that specifically and totally like, you know, when you&#8217;ve especially if you&#8217;ve been accustomed to winning, doing succeeding and then you hit some failures and or trying to do anything big and new, take that next job, start that new endeavor, whatever that is, and that, you know, oh, this is not a guaranteed success.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cory Miller (00:17:35) &#8211; So that that definitely resonates.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Kelly Gallagher (00:17:37) &#8211; Right? And if I fail, that also relates to a further theme of then the fear of being actually seen for who you are. Um, yeah, it&#8217;s a heavy topic and it can take a while to work through, but it&#8217;s, I think most of my clients will say that&#8217;s valuable work. And it&#8217;s not that they become fearless, but I think they&#8217;re able to notice the emotion name and then kind of negotiated.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cory Miller (00:18:08) &#8211; Yeah, you mentioned the word emotions. And I think when I first started working with you, I didn&#8217;t I didn&#8217;t go to that realm. I was, you know, okay, more intellectual thinking process and stuff. And you&#8217;re extremely helpful with that. And probably because of some of the, you know, understandings between therapy and coaching or misunderstanding to say, I didn&#8217;t really get into that. But I think our best work has come with the emotions. Like my my definitely I&#8217;ve benefited every time we&#8217;ve talked. I&#8217;ve been better for it. However, I think the most profound times is when we get into, okay, I&#8217;m doing this thing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cory Miller (00:18:48) &#8211; It&#8217;s an event, like you said, a struggle or something new or a change or something I&#8217;m preparing for. But then okay, the emotion around that and understanding that and leveraging, you know, really deep dive into that where I&#8217;m trying to improve. I can&#8217;t remember how many times you&#8217;ve said to me, okay, well they are not in this call. What is the what about you? And I was like, Oh man, doing that hard work, which is made I know it&#8217;s made me better as a professional and a leader for sure, because oftentimes you kind of redirect back to me and go, okay, well, they&#8217;re not here. Let&#8217;s talk about what this means to you, for you. And I&#8217;m always like, Well, let me take a deep breath on that one.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Kelly Gallagher (00:19:31) &#8211; That&#8217;s a hard one. I learned that actually didn&#8217;t learn that at Utd or anywhere. I learned that as a young rep out in the field and I complain about these idiot customers. Right? And the manager told me once, he said, Turn your rearview mirror to your face.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Kelly Gallagher (00:19:48) &#8211; And I didn&#8217;t. He goes, Now look at that. That&#8217;s the person that would have to change. The client&#8217;s not going to change. And it was the most profound thing. It kind of hurt my feelings, but it was so true.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cory Miller (00:20:01) &#8211; Well, I&#8217;ve talked through everything with you from partner team issues, all that. And it&#8217;s been so helpful because I think oftentimes kind of thinking, okay, yeah, they&#8217;ve got to change. There&#8217;s something with them. And the real work, profound and deep, that continues to get deeper is what does that mean for me about me? What do do I need to change something and what is that? And those are the times really in reflective work that I go, okay. And more and more I think I&#8217;m getting it. Or I go, okay, So something I&#8217;m not aware about myself potentially pointing outwards and then going, I kind of need to turn the rearview mirror back to myself.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Kelly Gallagher (00:20:46) &#8211; Back to your face? Yes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cory Miller (00:20:48) &#8211; It&#8217;s not the easiest thing to do, but I&#8217;m glad you do it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Kelly Gallagher (00:20:50) &#8211; It&#8217;s not the easiest thing to do. And in periods of conflict or intense conversations with bosses or calling people, you&#8217;re supervising, it&#8217;s extremely hard to stop yourself and say, wait a minute, who am I? And yeah, it&#8217;s it&#8217;s really, really hard. But I think as people progress in coaching, they become almost a coach within themselves.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cory Miller (00:21:16) &#8211; Yes. Yes. I can hear you quite a bit doing that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Kelly Gallagher (00:21:21) &#8211; Yeah. Oh yeah. So that would be my goal is that when I&#8217;m not there because I&#8217;m not there all the time and I don&#8217;t know of it, even though I know so much, I don&#8217;t know all of it. But my goal would be when that person&#8217;s gone for a week or they&#8217;re in a high stress situation, they&#8217;re able to somewhat coach themselves through it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cory Miller (00:21:44) &#8211; Absolutely. Well, okay. So we talked about like the struggle conflict. Something&#8217;s going on there. Want to do reach something new? Maybe they&#8217;re evaluating a big change. I mean, that resonates with me. I was that&#8217;s how we kicked off our thing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cory Miller (00:21:59) &#8211; It was like I was changing my profession career very substantially, knew I was going to be leaving the company I started. And, you know, okay, here&#8217;s a totally new avenue and having somebody to talk that through the fear of failure, the emotions of being an achiever, especially a high achiever, trying to do something in the world like an entrepreneur, what are some other things that you you see often in your coaching?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Kelly Gallagher (00:22:27) &#8211; Well, I would say the other thing, the theme is some type of organizational change, because your organization, of course, they&#8217;re always changing. And there are new standards that people don&#8217;t. We talked about that before we went on tape that sometimes people don&#8217;t like change. So being able to go in and help a person challenge their assumptions about the change really recognize within themselves the any negative thinking loops or or extra baggage they&#8217;re bringing in the situation and then thrive throughout the change would be a big thing. Um, and as they go along to they learn about themselves and then to integrate that learning.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Kelly Gallagher (00:23:12) &#8211; Back into the organization. That&#8217;s changing because change is constant. Yep. I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;ve ever been in an organization in 30 years that wasn&#8217;t doing some type of change. It&#8217;s almost never stay.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cory Miller (00:23:31) &#8211; It&#8217;s yeah, absolutely. Well, there&#8217;s two things I think about when we&#8217;ve worked together and what I know of coaching too. It&#8217;s it&#8217;s the word change that you said. Some change. Big change oftentimes big change. The other side of the coin for me is performance.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Kelly Gallagher (00:23:47) &#8211; So yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cory Miller (00:23:49) &#8211; Continual performance. So like and I think about those listening in why you won&#8217;t get you want to get coaching for yourself and your team is that performance factor like it&#8217;s an investment back into yourself or your team if you&#8217;re providing coaching. I think some great organizations, particularly in WordPress I&#8217;ve heard of because I&#8217;ve referred people to you that happen to be in WordPress. I go, Oh, I love the forward thinking of that. You&#8217;re going, it&#8217;s an investment in their people, but the performance side. So we&#8217;ve talked a lot of some about this change side.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cory Miller (00:24:24) &#8211; There&#8217;s something going on and how we wrestle and adapt to that change where we talk about motions and different things and then but the other side to me is like, I can&#8217;t remember how many times I call it performance, but what I think it is, is like preparation. I mean, some of the biggest deals I&#8217;ve done in five years have been rehearsed, practiced, polished, perhaps even with you. And gosh, I didn&#8217;t have that my previous ten years. And I thought, wow, I went into so many situations. I thought I had done my preparation. But doing it with you with a coach was made things so much better, I think, through that process. Kelly It also eliminated like things I wasn&#8217;t aware of, things I hadn&#8217;t thought about, and just an approach to get some, like, clarity.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Kelly Gallagher (00:25:12) &#8211; Flirty, some big one. And I think that goes into the third bucket of communication skills. Just people sometimes come to me and in her struggle or there&#8217;s conflict or they&#8217;re going into a big sales promotion and they&#8217;re not quite sure how to go about it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Kelly Gallagher (00:25:29) &#8211; So that would all fall into the bucket of communication skills. And that that&#8217;s a big one. I don&#8217;t think oftentimes people think they&#8217;re coming across one way, but it&#8217;s quite different if you&#8217;re observing them. The other thing is. They, you know, like you said, you&#8217;ll rehearse. And rehearse. But when you get in that situation sometimes. Hopefully you&#8217;re primed with enough rehearsal to lean back. If you forget what you&#8217;re going to say, you can lean back into the gist of it. So I think for performance, though, it comes down to communication skills and confidence, because in selling some time it&#8217;s not what you said anyway, it&#8217;s how you said it. And you can walk in if you say it with conviction and you have that internal clarity, as you mentioned, and conviction. The little wordsmithing and nuances of it aren&#8217;t going to matter. They&#8217;re going to matter. But the big the capital A to achievement or performance is how you set it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cory Miller (00:26:36) &#8211; Well, I didn&#8217;t say this in the beginning, but we we now meet twice a week and we&#8217;ve I think we&#8217;ve met twice a week for the last year or two.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cory Miller (00:26:44) &#8211; And that was out of, oh, I need these times. We&#8217;re kind of booking them at the front of the week and the end of the week. But oftentimes I realize so many times it&#8217;s just seeking clarity for myself and those of us who are leaders out there trying to give a clear vision to somebody else, I&#8217;ll just say it. Maybe other leaders just wake up with clairvoyant vision. I don&#8217;t. I need rehearsal. I need work. I need to bounce it off people. I need a coach to help me kind of ask questions, think, think it through. And every single time I&#8217;m better. I remember some of the biggest ones that I&#8217;ve, like, talked to you. And it&#8217;s not even one session, maybe 2 or 3. They end up talking about it. But I go, Gosh, if I hadn&#8217;t had that, I would have made so many mistakes going into that big decision or time of presentation, whatever that was. And I&#8217;m so better for like I just need to practice and realize I couldn&#8217;t just do that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cory Miller (00:27:40) &#8211; I needed someone else to help me. And that&#8217;s where you&#8217;ve come in and done that. And so clarity for me is like when you say, what? When people would ask me, What&#8217;s the biggest takeaway for coaching? I go clarity and what is clarity? Build what you said confidence. And those two alone have made me a better leader. That&#8217;s why I can say, let&#8217;s just go back to the start of my career. If I&#8217;d had a coach, it started my career. Everything would have been better because I&#8217;ve been more clear, more confident.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Kelly Gallagher (00:28:03) &#8211; Being a millionaire ten times over just had a coach because I did so many stupid things along with the good things. That you don&#8217;t know, but you do learn from failure. You do learn. Oh, and so, you know, maybe not, but I sure would have liked to have a coach. It is a perk for high performers. If if if you if it&#8217;s a if there&#8217;s an employer listening in and they&#8217;re thinking of who does that need coaching? Yes, it can be remedial, but sometimes then it&#8217;s not the employees idea.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Kelly Gallagher (00:28:34) &#8211; The high performance will progress the fastest because it generally will be their idea. They want that perk and they want to grow a career.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cory Miller (00:28:44) &#8211; This is my personal opinion, not Kelly. So I want to be clear about that. But I&#8217;ve been around organizations that use coaching as remedial, and I go, Then what happens is coaching gets stigmatized within that organization of if you&#8217;re not performing and you&#8217;re doing a crappy job, you&#8217;re going to get sent. And it has a negative tint to coaching, which is not what it&#8217;s supposed to be. It&#8217;s supposed to be progressing positive, helping improving, navigating situations. And this one organization in particular, it&#8217;s like that&#8217;s how they use coaching. I go, Oh man, Like, then they then all these high performers have this worry about it and don&#8217;t want to potentially go into coaching and miss this incredible benefit to what coaching is.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Kelly Gallagher (00:29:31) &#8211; That&#8217;s so true. There&#8217;s someone at my door. Can I. Can we pause?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cory Miller (00:29:36) &#8211; Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Kelly Gallagher (00:29:45) &#8211; Yeah, we&#8217;re talking about, like, high performers and performance coaching. And I do want to make the point that that&#8217;s kind of what I think is my differentiator is that I have all that coaching training, but also I&#8217;ve been in the business world for 30 years selling. So if someone asked me about that, it&#8217;s easy for me to switch out. Yeah, most coaches have like a background, so they&#8217;ve never really had to go out into the world and perform, right?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cory Miller (00:30:17) &#8211; Yeah. You bring both sides to that coin I think is incredibly helpful. Like I&#8217;ve talked so much with you about cells because it&#8217;s a weak area. I feel like it&#8217;s a weak area for me, but something I&#8217;ve had to do but forced to do and now trying to begrudgingly trying to do it. But I know you&#8217;ve got such an extensive sales background, business development background that totally leveraged that. In fact I think that&#8217;s how our two times a week started was a sales academy where it wasn&#8217;t necessarily coaching, it was more like sales coaching.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Kelly Gallagher (00:30:47) &#8211; Right. And it&#8217;s very hard for someone to coach you if they haven&#8217;t walked down the street, guide you down the path. If I&#8217;ve never been on it, I can coach and I can move you in many ways, but can&#8217;t exactly help you to perform because I don&#8217;t know how to perform. So I think that is the differentiator in my coaching style as I&#8217;ve been there. I&#8217;ve been in sales meetings where I got humiliated. I&#8217;ve had clients slam doors in my face. You know, I&#8217;ve executed $1 million contract. So. I just think it helps me to bring more to the party.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cory Miller (00:31:25) &#8211; Yeah. And you understand the complete picture. That&#8217;s why, you know, our community is a lot of founders and a lot of high achiever leaders. You know, I&#8217;m curious your thoughts about entrepreneurship, entrepreneurs and coaching. You know, I don&#8217;t know your risk, your client base, but I am one. I know I&#8217;ve benefited from incredibly navigating change, big decisions and the performance side. But what do you say to entrepreneurs about coaching?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Kelly Gallagher (00:31:58) &#8211; I&#8217;d say it&#8217;s essential because of everything we&#8217;ve talked about in the end.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Kelly Gallagher (00:32:04) &#8211; As an entrepreneur, you&#8217;re alone, right? That&#8217;s what it is. That&#8217;s the gig. You might have a few people on your team, but generally you&#8217;re alone. It&#8217;s very hard to win deals in isolation. So I would say having a business coach is key to moving forward. Not only in all the things we mentioned, the clarity, the communication, the conflict, the struggle, but then sometimes you just have to go execute. And so for me, it&#8217;s very helpful because I&#8217;ve been in that sales situation so many times and understand features, benefits. I understand how to extrapolate from a client what&#8217;s going to really matter and what&#8217;s not. And I can help people with their slide deck or, you know, whatever it is they want to. So I will generally I can come in in that regard like we do and be a consultant on Friday, but a coach on Mondays. And then and most of my clients who are entrepreneurs use me in that way. Like they will sometimes just bring us like back or we&#8217;ll practice a presentation or they&#8217;ll practice what they&#8217;re going to say to their team before they say it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cory Miller (00:33:18) &#8211; Yep.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Kelly Gallagher (00:33:18) &#8211; Get some clarity around it to understand. How they&#8217;re feeling in that moment of saying these wonderful things they think are are going to move the team. And sometimes they come out of the meeting and they&#8217;re going to say something completely different. Once we do the coaching, it&#8217;s not that I ever told them to say anything different, but we, you know, polished it. Let&#8217;s say, you know, they come out with this big chunk of coal and they leave and they&#8217;ve got a little diamond and it&#8217;s polished. And like you said earlier, they feel confident.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cory Miller (00:33:50) &#8211; Maybe there&#8217;s some entrepreneurs that that come fully birthed into the whole process, but most of us have to learn it and grow through it. What I&#8217;m hearing, though, you know, big decisions, big challenges, big changes, and then the performance side preparation, Polish getting ready for those big things, too. And then the simply put, just trying to make the most of the opportunity. That&#8217;s what I think about. Like so many high achievers that go with an entrepreneur&#8217;s, like we have an opportunity.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cory Miller (00:34:24) &#8211; We often like my my story is I stumbled into it, stumbled into it and go, wow, I have this amazing opportunity. So much with business. You go like, it&#8217;s right timing, it&#8217;s right place, right people, right, partners, all the things that have to go together for something to go really well. And then you go, I want to make the most of that. And that&#8217;s my reflection, is that I had an opportunity. I wanted to seize that opportunity to make the most of it. Now, seeing, Oh, wow. Now I did have a coach during about half of my business time, invaluable to help us with the organization. But I go like having someone that this is why we keep working together as I go. I just need it. It&#8217;s just a part of making the most of who I am and my opportunities that come my way to to do even more. And it&#8217;s not necessarily just about money, but it&#8217;s about making the most of the opportunity.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Kelly Gallagher (00:35:18) &#8211; Right.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Kelly Gallagher (00:35:19) &#8211; And Joy, while you&#8217;re doing you we haven&#8217;t even touched about that. But there&#8217;s that personal happiness factor and a lot of my clients either are working out or I have them. I try to persuade them to start a fitness program while they&#8217;re with me. But that joy, that love of what you&#8217;re doing, you know, if it&#8217;s not there, it&#8217;s very hard to perform on your.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cory Miller (00:35:43) &#8211; Yeah. And you&#8217;ve been such a good coach and you walk that talk. Kelly was telling me before we started the recording that she just ran a mile and swam, and I was like, Gosh, you overachiever. But it&#8217;s such a good inspiration for me for sure, because that other aspect of just life and business and everything is just being physically healthy. And you are a great encourager and you walk your talk.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Kelly Gallagher (00:36:07) &#8211; I try. I try. I try. I mean, no one&#8217;s perfect. But yeah, I definitely try. And I also find because I work out a lot and I&#8217;m more effective for people because, you know, it brings all that blood flow to the brain.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Kelly Gallagher (00:36:20) &#8211; So I shared with Cory that sometimes in between clients I&#8217;ll just run up the hill outside my house 4 or 5 times just to sharpen myself for the next person because I can feel it within myself. Then I come in their house and I&#8217;m all happy again and I&#8217;m feeling creative and supercharged and ready to go.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cory Miller (00:36:41) &#8211; Oh yeah. You can tell what the energy you have for sure. Well, Kelly, thanks so much for taking the time to talk to us about what you&#8217;re doing. Share a little bit of the experience. I mean, they resonate with me. Everything you&#8217;ve talked about are things that we&#8217;ve worked on in our coaching sessions, and I&#8217;ve been better for it as a person on Earth, as a human, on earth, as a business entrepreneur, leader, all those. But anything else that you want to share that we didn&#8217;t get to talk about?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Kelly Gallagher (00:37:09) &#8211; No, I mean, what you just said, that&#8217;s what I live for. That&#8217;s my passion is did I, you know, did I help someone? Did they feel better after we, you know, did we move the bar? And I just live for success stories.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Kelly Gallagher (00:37:23) &#8211; And I find it so much more rewarding than just pure sales. Although I would have argued back then that I was making people&#8217;s lives better because I had a terrific product or whatever, but somehow that what you just said, just seeing personal growth in other people, I just kind of live for that. So thank you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cory Miller (00:37:43) &#8211; Bet. Well, thanks, Keller, for being on. And thanks, everybody, for listening. We&#8217;ll share in the show notes how you can get a hold of Kelly if you&#8217;re interested in talking more with her. She&#8217;s fantastic. Coach, you can&#8217;t. I&#8217;ve referred you numerous times to people that now I believe are our regular clients with you. And we they&#8217;re defensive minded and we always talk like, yep, I just had my Kelly session, just had my Kelly Sessions, so.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Kelly Gallagher (00:38:08) &#8211; Well, thank you for doing that. Yes. I don&#8217;t really advertise. I haven&#8217;t ever. I only did maybe in the first year. But I think that&#8217;s the other thing. Good coaches just kind of get referrals and.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Kelly Gallagher (00:38:21) &#8211; That&#8217;s the way it should be.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cory Miller (00:38:23) &#8211; You do. All right. Thanks, everybody, for listening to Post Status Draft. It&#8217;s been another episode kind of went out of our league but love to introduce people that have made an indelible difference in my life and to share their wisdom. So we&#8217;ll see everybody next time.

Welcome back to Post Status Draft. Got another great interview in our agency Journey series and I&#8217;m talking with JJ Toothman, a member of Post Status and JJ, Hey, thanks for coming on post this draft and talking about your agency journey story.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>J.J. Toothman (00:00:18) &#8211; Hey, thanks for having me. Cory. It&#8217;s great to be here. Um, really appreciate everything you do for post status and for the community. So I&#8217;m happy to be, um, you know, a member of both. So.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cory Miller (00:00:32) &#8211; Awesome. Well, we&#8217;ve gotten to get to know each other over the last, like, I&#8217;d say, what, eight months and hear about some of the work that your agency does. It&#8217;s super, super exciting. But can you tell me about the agency where it is now? Team clients kind of work. You kind of do.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>J.J. Toothman (00:00:50) &#8211; There&#8217;s my dog and wife.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cory Miller (00:00:54) &#8211; Great introduction.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>J.J. Toothman (00:00:55) &#8211; Yeah. Um, so the. So my company is Lone Rock Point and I am located outside of Boston, Massachusetts, in a town called Sudbury.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>J.J. Toothman (00:01:09) &#8211; Um, if you know the Revolutionary War history, you remember the Battle of Lexington and Concord and Sudbury borders. Concord. I live about five miles from where Paul Revere was captured at the end of his famous ride to tell everybody the British were coming. Oh, wow. Lone Rock Point. We have grown it to 16 people. You know, 12 of those people are full time. And there&#8217;s a handful of of, of part timers. Um, the were distributed all over the place. Uh, I&#8217;ve got, you know, some of us are in California, Texas. Uh, Michigan. There&#8217;s a few people in around Grand Rapids. There&#8217;s people in Florida, a few people around Asheville, North Carolina. And we definitely, you know, adopted a remote first, you know, virtual kind of organization, organizational structure from the very beginning. You know, when when the pandemic happened in 2020, we didn&#8217;t miss a beat. You know, our the people that we were working with, you know, just it just continued.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>J.J. Toothman (00:02:29) &#8211; It&#8217;s weird to look back on that time and think about the, you know, ways that we were able to grow during that time in a period where so many small businesses were were, you know, struggling. But, you know, look back on that time and think about like we, you know, we were, you know, going remote, being virtual. That wasn&#8217;t a problem for us. We were ready to do that for the very beginning. And the people we were worked with, like just we just kept working on it, kept asking for more from us. It was actually a period of growth for us. We probably went from, you know, at the beginning of. You know, spring 2020, we were around four people and 4 or 5, and now we&#8217;re 16. We became a WordPress agency approximately 15, 16 months ago. Um, and we joined WordPress is kind of a continuation of our work with the public sector when I started my company in 2016. Um, you know that we can talk about the genesis of that, but it was, you know, I was had come from a federal government contracting world and I&#8217;ve been working for big companies like Raytheon, um, Perot Systems, Dell and, you know, decided that, you know, I wanted to start my own company, you know, had this, you know, the proverbial entrepreneurial itch that most entrepreneurs feel and just kind of wanted to try that out.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>J.J. Toothman (00:04:02) &#8211; So I started to serve this company and wanted to start working. There were two customers that I wanted to work with from the very beginning, and one of those was NASA, which is it&#8217;s hard for me to talk about my own journey and the work that we&#8217;re doing without connecting to the long history I have working with with NASA. So I use that relationship and that relationship capital that I&#8217;ve built, you know, from starting working with them back in as early as 2001. Well, one of my first clients and then one of my second clients, big clients was Automattic. Some people over there that had built relationships over the years came to me and said, Hey, you know a lot about, you know, this public sector world, you know, federal government contracting. Can you help us, you know, with kind of get into that vertical and so help them with some some business strategy around that? I helped them with some security compliance, things they needed to be aware of. And then that relation, you know, that work kind of matured a little bit and kind of ran its course a little bit.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>J.J. Toothman (00:05:15) &#8211; And then, you know, as they as WordPress VIP, you know, kind of solidified its it&#8217;s standing and it&#8217;s got themselves into what&#8217;s called the Fedramp marketplace. You know, they came to me and said, Hey, you should, you know, your company, you should we should continue working together. You should join the WordPress Agency partnership program. And that&#8217;s something I did, you know, specifically because of our shared interest in working together on public sector opportunities. And, um, you know, that&#8217;s, that&#8217;s, that&#8217;s, that&#8217;s really what my company is doing right now is, you know, Lone Rock Point. We are, we&#8217;re definitely exploring that intersection of WordPress and public SpaC, public sector, predominantly the federal level of that. You know, there&#8217;s a lot of state and municipal stuff opportunities there as well. Um, but we&#8217;re, you know, the, the kind of the, when you think of like WordPress and public sector, what I want people to come out of that connection with is is Lone Rock point and so that&#8217;s you know that&#8217;s work we&#8217;re doing with and and work we&#8217;re doing with NASA and it&#8217;s going we&#8217;ve been working on some projects from NASA for the past few years.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>J.J. Toothman (00:06:31) &#8211; And it&#8217;s it&#8217;s really rewarding work. It&#8217;s good to feel like you&#8217;re contributing to. You know, we&#8217;re not civil servants, but we&#8217;re definitely kind of contributing to. You know, putting the taxpayer dollars to work, being good stewards of taxpayer money. And we think WordPress has a a role in that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cory Miller (00:06:54) &#8211; Excellent. Well, there&#8217;s a lot here I want to unpack, but it&#8217;s so compelling. Congratulations on your success. Congratulations on what you&#8217;ve done in the public sector to take WordPress there. I love hearing stories like yours and our other members doing good work in our world. And I get to I think I&#8217;ve told you, I get to brag, Hey, I know the people working on these projects, you know, which is pretty fantastic, and taking WordPress to the Enterprise, but Public sector Spaces is really fantastic as WordPress grows. So okay, I want to I want to thank you for telling us kind of what Lone Lone Rock Point does today. So I heard in there 2016. So I, I had assumed, as we had talked for because of the kind of work you&#8217;re doing, you had been doing this particular agency type work for a long time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cory Miller (00:07:49) &#8211; But wow, that&#8217;s why I say congrats one, Congratulations on your success. But like it&#8217;s pretty fast timeline to be able to get to doing an agency to doing this kind of work, I think. But can you take me back like before 2016, you said you were doing enterprise or. Yeah, public sector government, government contracting work. What were you doing before the agency?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>J.J. Toothman (00:08:10) &#8211; Before. Before I founded my agency. Yeah. Yeah. So I was, I was a software developer, web application developer. I got hired by Raytheon to work on a contract they had with NASA Ames Research Center. And back in 2001, actually, the thing that the opportunity that kind of brought me into that world was that&#8217;s when they first started thinking about like, what do they have to do about website accessibility? So they brought me in there to kind of help, you know, help, you know, mature what they were doing around all that kind of stuff. And it&#8217;s been interesting to see what the what where was thinking about this over the last couple of weeks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>J.J. Toothman (00:08:57) &#8211; You know, when I first started working at NASA Ames and started talking about website accessibility and looking at all the various websites and web applications that was that were running at Ames Research Center, which is one of the, you know, field centers that&#8217;s part of the the NASA enterprise. Um, there was people were really just they were really resistant to it. They were trying to. They were trying to check the box on it quite a bit. You know, they were just like, What&#8217;s the minimum I have to do to, like, just check the box on this and so I can move on. Like it really the the optics of how important that was and just it just being the generally the right thing to do, forget the whole legal requirements of it all that really just wasn&#8217;t cemented. And here we are, you know, 20 plus years later where, you know, that&#8217;s that&#8217;s kind of like at the core of what is happening definitely in the public sector, but in the web in general, just like this, this strong emphasis on making it accessible and available to everybody.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>J.J. Toothman (00:10:00) &#8211; You know, I saw how that started, you know, 20 years ago. And it&#8217;s it was not the same temperature, both from various from developers, designers, project managers, you know, that whole thing is shifted in very positive ways over the last couple of decades. So I was a software developer there working on various, um, you know, web applications, internal business process type applications, looking at accessibility improvements. Um, and then just kind of grew things over the years, you know, you know, started, you know, started rising the ranks a little bit, like getting opportunities to understand how government projects actually work, how it works, which is a pretty thing. I started participating in proposals that big companies like Dell were doing and responding to government RFPs, which are massive undertakings unto themselves, um, understanding compliance and security regulations that exist in government, in government, and really just kind of understanding how these governments, these government agencies and, you know, as individual as they kind of have their own ecosystems unto themselves, that&#8217;s probably not, you know, unique to all various massive, you know, corporate enterprises.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>J.J. Toothman (00:11:29) &#8211; You know, we talk a little bit about the WordPress ecosystem now, but these these federal government agencies, they all have their own ecosystems around it. And then they&#8217;re also operating in this big federal thing where there&#8217;s kind of like this. Um, Jennifer Palka just wrote this great book called Recoding America, and she calls this term friendly fire. So where there&#8217;s like things where like the Office of Management, the OMB and General Services Administrations and other offices and agencies within the executive branch and other parts of government are putting together governance and policy around it and how the web should work. Um, and it creates all this types of, you know, these, this guidance and guardrails that you have to adhere to. So that becomes like kind of a larger ecosystem unto itself. So, you know, starting to understand how to work within that type of, um, you know, those types of scenarios and guardrails and boundaries and knowing how to interoperate it all just became, you know, something that started gaining more experience with and more exposure to with and, you know, think it&#8217;s been a big, you know, that knowledge is a big part of like why, you know, my company&#8217;s positioned and why we&#8217;ve achieved some success.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>J.J. Toothman (00:12:44) &#8211; You know, working and and gaining some credibility in parts of the public sector and procuring our relationship with with WordPress VIP and, you know, expanding our own opportunities within itself. Yeah, it&#8217;s exciting. It&#8217;s challenging. Exhausting at times, but it&#8217;s also exciting and rewarding.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cory Miller (00:13:04) &#8211; Yeah. Yeah. I can&#8217;t imagine. So just just for clarity. So you&#8217;re working full time at Raytheon or were you contract as a software?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>J.J. Toothman (00:13:12) &#8211; So a contract means you&#8217;re you&#8217;re you&#8217;re like you&#8217;re kind of embedded, so you&#8217;re a full time employee and you&#8217;re your government contractor working on a contract that, you know, a company like Raytheon or Dell or Booz Allen or Lockheed Martin has with the federal government to deliver services abilities that are part of their requirements.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cory Miller (00:13:39) &#8211; Okay. Okay. That totally makes sense. So what was that catalytic moment when you&#8217;re like, Hey, I&#8217;m gonna do this for myself, I&#8217;m gonna start my agency?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>J.J. Toothman (00:13:46) &#8211; Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cory Miller (00:13:47) &#8211; So prompted that. Um.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>J.J. Toothman (00:13:50) &#8211; A couple of things. So I left NASA for a while and I went and worked for a company, a music ticketing startup called Ticket Fly.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>J.J. Toothman (00:13:58) &#8211; I helped them, like, basically create a network of websites for small independent music venues, um, and help those music venues talk about, you know, what shows were coming, how to buy tickets, you know, when the on sale dates were and all the other, you know, all that content that is basically all about converting into ticket sales. And so I was with was, you know, with them when they were really small. And, you know, it was definitely the startup world and that was really exciting. It was also a bad time for my life. I just had like my my second child and like my work life balance was it was it was pretty bad. Um, you know, working at a small startup like that. So ended up going back to NASA. Um, you know, and just trying to, like, find my footing a little bit. I also wanted to leave California and move relocate back to the East Coast. And I knew that was, you know, being in a place, a large organization like that would offer some flexibility like that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>J.J. Toothman (00:15:05) &#8211; Um, but then, you know, I would say around a decade, you know, ten years ago. I started having this, you know, I started having that entrepreneurial itch again. I started thinking about, like, how fun it was to, you know, move fast at ticket fly and wanted that that feeling again. And so I started, you know, I explored a couple of like side hustles, you know, some small little independent web projects. One of them was like a newsletter to help families spend more time outdoors. And they didn&#8217;t really take off. They didn&#8217;t really get get some traction. And what I mean by that, it wasn&#8217;t necessarily traction from a, you know, where we&#8217;re making revenue or gaining customers. We were just like just the balance of of, you know, trying to do do that type of initiative while, you know, having a full time job and also like, you know, having a growing family and all that kind of stuff. And then in but was it was clear that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>J.J. Toothman (00:16:06) &#8211; You know, I was exploring something. And, you know, again, that desire to to like be in more, you know, control of of of my destiny, so to speak, and be entrepreneurial is something I just couldn&#8217;t I couldn&#8217;t get rid of completely. And it wasn&#8217;t happening within big companies like Dell in the way that I wanted to know. I really wanted to be, you know, in control of a lot of decisions that wasn&#8217;t in control of, um, and, you know, that&#8217;s why people start their own things and, you know, be founders of companies. And, you know, I had dinner with a friend of mine who was also in the government contracting space. He&#8217;s like, you know, you&#8217;ve been thinking about. And he told me he&#8217;s like, You&#8217;ve been thinking about all these little product ideas, these digital product ideas, like, you know, just just start a services business, you know, like and that will satisfy your need or the desire. You have to be entrepreneurial and, you know, like, you know, look at balance sheets and think about marketing and, you know, attracting talent and retaining talent and stuff like that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>J.J. Toothman (00:17:12) &#8211; And he was right. He was like, You know what? That&#8217;s a really good idea. And within 120 days, I&#8217;d like set the wheels in motion to, you know, start Lone Rock Point. Um, and, you know, we, we went from there. So it started in the fall of I started the company in the fall of 2016. It was just me for, you know, a year. And then it was like me and a virtual assistant for like another year. And I, you know, I started under this like this umbrella of like, digital transformation consulting. At the time, I was doing a lot of work with the public sector around cloud transformations. So people were were operating applications and on premise data centers and starting to make that migration into things like Amazon Web Services. And so working out a lot of change management type type projects associated with that. And it all kind of just fit under this like big umbrella of digital and cloud transformation, which, to be totally honest with you, is, is is too vague and too broad and borderline meaningless.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>J.J. Toothman (00:18:25) &#8211; You know, if you ask ten different people what digital transformation is, you&#8217;re probably going to get ten different definitions of it. Yeah. And so it&#8217;s really hard to like, you know, grow a services business out that way is really just like me being a consultant at that point. Um, and it wasn&#8217;t until like started niching down into, you know what, like let&#8217;s just do this WordPress thing, you know, was I was delivering, um, you know, whitepapers and providing analysis of like how what people should do with like their, their inventory of web applications and advising them on what is and what platforms they should be using. And a lot of times ended up started like you know, making recommendations around WordPress oriented applications, sometimes just building WordPress sites, sometimes using WordPress as an application framework. Um, in over the, in the time I&#8217;ve been with NASA. I&#8217;ve used WordPress with them and a lot of different ways. We&#8217;ve done it in a WordPress network multi-site kind of way for allowing smaller NASA missions and programs and projects to, you know, have their own websites where they all communicate what they&#8217;re up to and what their findings are and share what they learned with, you know, with, with interested stakeholders and visitors to their sites.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>J.J. Toothman (00:19:55) &#8211; Um, there, there&#8217;s been some internal things where needed to like communicate various services as it had to various corners of the agency. So we did like a WooCommerce thing where people can go to a web application, a website and just pick what, what services they want. Like I need, I need some Amazon cloud storage or processing or, you know, EC2 units. And they could apply, they could add all those things to a cart and then say, check out and, you know, check, you know, do a checkout with that and just start getting services provided to them that way. So um, and then, you know, over time it just became clear that like, this is, I keep recommending this, like there&#8217;s growth opportunity for me here and then, you know, niching down to being like, we&#8217;re going to be a WordPress, a more traditional WordPress agency is really when, you know, the growth started happening and the opportunity started becoming a little bit. And it isn&#8217;t just like strategic consulting, it became the execution part of it as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>J.J. Toothman (00:21:00) &#8211; And the tactics part of it too, and the tactics and execution. We&#8217;re all oriented for the most of the time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cory Miller (00:21:06) &#8211; Yeah, I&#8217;d love to hear these stories because you got, you know, a big career in enterprise and public sector, you know, with your Raytheon and NASA days and then entrepreneurial hit. Okay, want to do this and then seeing you know when you say NASA and WordPress, it just seems like those things should always go together, you know, and that&#8217;s what really compelling to me is seeing WordPress more on the public sector enterprise. And now there&#8217;s really big institutions in in the US federal government anyway, probably around the world too, but that are starting to use WordPress more and more and leverage it and see that opportunity. Um, so I love kind of how those intersection of things happen. So that lone rock point would kind of exist and grow and then you hit your I was going to ask the question when the WordPress come into play, but you pretty much answered it. So like your 2 or 3 or so, it seems like, hey, we&#8217;re going to drill down.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cory Miller (00:22:04) &#8211; And then when you mention WooCommerce that like that use case for an internal tool within a big organization like that to procure and get resources and things, that&#8217;s so compelling. You know, most of my.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>J.J. Toothman (00:22:17) &#8211; Career that like, people just wanted that checkout expert, They wanted that. They wanted that experience of like, I want X, Y and Z, I want to add it to the cart and I want to tell you that I want it. And we just, you know, WooCommerce has that option to, you know, just do check payments, right? Which removes the credit card processing out of it. And so we kind of adapted that to, all right, we&#8217;re going to send this order to somebody who can fulfill that order via this WooCommerce WordPress system. Um, and, you know, it&#8217;s, it&#8217;s, it&#8217;s, you know, it&#8217;s using the WordPress ecosystem at its best, like using it almost kind of as Legos and want this part of it. I want that part of it. I want to, I want to glue them together in this way.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>J.J. Toothman (00:22:58) &#8211; And it&#8217;s, you know, kind of a no code kind of way around WordPress to solve some, you know, some very simple, narrow use cases. But, you know, my, my journey with WordPress, you know, starts way back in 2007 at my first stint with at Ames Research Center. Um, you know, I was working with all these various scientists and researchers and they just like need a place to like publish my, my research findings and publish my data and, and they, they all one, they all had the same, um. You know, requirements and needs. At the highest level, it&#8217;s like I just need a place to put it. And I want to I want to be able to manage it myself in a way. And I don&#8217;t know. I don&#8217;t know how to don&#8217;t know how to code. I don&#8217;t know. I don&#8217;t have anybody on my team who knows HTML. And so that, you know, that basically introduced the concept of like content management systems into all this back in 2007.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>J.J. Toothman (00:24:03) &#8211; And, you know, we were looking at things like wikis at the time and, and then discovered WordPress and around that and just the user experience of someone just, you know, managing their content with that type of, you know, WordPress, CMS, this is like version 2.0 of WordPress, you know, back when they added pages in addition to posts was the real thing. That&#8217;s like, oh, this is what this satisfies what everyone&#8217;s looking for. They want an easy place just to log into. And you know, they all some of them wanted to start blogging. Some of them wanted to start blogging without knowing that they wanted to start blogging. They just want to share what they know and tell their stories. Um, and then back in 2007, I created this is also the Web 2.0 era where, you know, your blogging was, was kind of heavy in the lexicon back then. And I was I did one of NASA&#8217;s first official public blogs on WordPress and, and kind of grew with WordPress, you know, from there that led to the ticket fly work.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>J.J. Toothman (00:25:13) &#8211; And so WordPress was kind of always in my DNA, even when wasn&#8217;t, you know, it wasn&#8217;t like a defined part of what I was, you know, of my, my role description. But my role was in some cases to be strategic and provide advice and provide some roadmaps. And, you know, how do we do things? Give us some give us some guidance here. And a lot of times just said like, well, you don&#8217;t have to create a custom bespoke application for this. Just use a content management system like WordPress, you know, teach your users how to how to how to manage using WordPress themselves. And and you go from there. So and the WordPress ecosystem is what makes all that happen mean there&#8217;s all these different, you know, there&#8217;s all these different plugins and themes and you just kind of integrate it all together, um, you know, in a unique way. And you have a great solution architecture, depending on how you put it together.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cory Miller (00:26:08) &#8211; What you&#8217;re talking kind of way back.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cory Miller (00:26:11) &#8211; But you know, remember a lot of the solutions that we have now didn&#8217;t exist. So, you know, big organizations were having to do like the the internal resourcing that you&#8217;re talking about. They&#8217;d have to custom code those things or build them because they didn&#8217;t exist off the shelf. Then you fast forward and you go, you could take WooCommerce save. I can&#8217;t even imagine how much time to kind of do git to feature like, you know, par with that and then take that open source solution and then utilize it and just customize with a with a great agency like you all to figure out what their exact needs are. So it&#8217;s it&#8217;s great to see how everything has fast forward to. Well, we touched on this. I know we&#8217;re going to have more conversations down the road. And and I want to talk more about the public sector and enterprise. And I know we&#8217;re talking and we&#8217;re going to have some great conversations in the next couple of months about this, because I know you&#8217;re passionate about it, about the public sector and bringing WordPress to the public sector, but we&#8217;ll save that for another time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cory Miller (00:27:07) &#8211; I don&#8217;t want to spoil too much of that, but I appreciate so much the journey and what you&#8217;re doing. So thank you for telling us that. That&#8217;s, that&#8217;s that&#8217;s incredible. Um, okay. What are you excited about today? What are you excited about today and the future going forward and what you&#8217;re doing with the agency and your team and the work you&#8217;re doing?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>J.J. Toothman (00:27:27) &#8211; Yeah. So a few years ago, the government, Pervez passed a Congress passed an act called the Integrated Digital Experience Act. And within that act is basically it tells all these federal agencies how to modernize their website. So, you know. Obvious things like improve accessibility. They have to be accessible. They have to work on mobile. They. They. You have to have like good search. They should. People should be able to find content there. They also need to be based on user research and user needs. So they&#8217;re all logical things within. You know, public sector and it&#8217;s all so I&#8217;m really excited about that. Be something that initiates or triggers a lot of the work that I&#8217;ve been doing for the last couple of years.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>J.J. Toothman (00:28:26) &#8211; And so for the last few years I&#8217;ve been working on a web modernization project with NASA. It exists for a couple of reasons. It exists. One, because of that idea act. It also exists because NASA has a couple of thousand websites and they don&#8217;t want there to be a couple of thousand websites. They want all that information in one website. So we&#8217;ve been doing a lot of work with them. You know, that started back in kind of mid 2000, late 2000, and it started with, hey, what should be using for its main, you know, web source, major web properties. And so I spent a year taking a look at the landscape of you know, of all the available CMS&#8217;s that are out there, you know, Drupal source site, Adobe Experience manager and then some new newer ones like Wagtail. And then there&#8217;s even we even took a look at, you know, some of the software as a service type solutions like Contentful and just trying to understand the pros and cons of Elda.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>J.J. Toothman (00:29:38) &#8211; And so we spent a year taking a look at the CMS landscape and acquiring data for it, acquiring evidence of it. And while in my heart, you know, being a WordPress guy, I knew like, you know, WordPress makes a lot of sense here. You know, we it&#8217;s still there was a lot of benefit for me to kind of like take a look at like what, you know, all the driving factors for making a decision like that were, um, and you know at the end of it WordPress like was the, the solution, the CMS that NASA wanted to invest in for the future. And that&#8217;s what we&#8217;ve been working on for the last couple of years. So for the last couple of years we&#8217;ve been working on a couple of big. Uh, NASA WordPress projects. And a lot of, you know, I talked a lot about how I&#8217;ve been using WordPress and a no code kind of way. This is not a no code kind of way. There was a lot of Gutenberg custom development here.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>J.J. Toothman (00:30:34) &#8211; It&#8217;s the, it&#8217;s, it&#8217;s the project that has everything like, you know, an emphasis on SEO, an emphasis on accessibility. There&#8217;s a new atomic design system that was created for this. And so the seeing the marriage of an atomic design system and Gutenberg, you know, come to bring all that stuff to life has been really, really exciting. And I&#8217;m excited to like for, for, you know, people, you know, interested in what NASA is up to and people interested in WordPress to see the fruits of all this labor that we&#8217;ve been working on for the last couple of years and it&#8217;s all coming in the next few months. And yeah, so I&#8217;m really excited to share that with you and share that with other people in the community.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cory Miller (00:31:19) &#8211; Yeah, that&#8217;s excellent. So I want to take just a minute in sidebar because you did this whole year, you know, one of seeing what&#8217;s out there, seeing what the options are. And I love that you&#8217;ve done some deep, deep research for big organizations trying to make a big, important decision on it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cory Miller (00:31:36) &#8211; Um, I&#8217;m just curious what we&#8217;re couple takeaways. As you just surveyed the landscape. You know, we love WordPress. We understand, you know, we, we support WordPress, but, but we know that there&#8217;s a lot of stuff out there. Um, but I&#8217;m curious, what, what did the landscape look like? Where were some of the things you saw when you looked at the other platforms you mentioned like Wagtail? I hadn&#8217;t heard that one before. I&#8217;ve heard of Contentful for instance, and of course Drupal. But what, what were a couple of the takeaways on that year of investigation out there?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>J.J. Toothman (00:32:08) &#8211; So the I, I would say that there are two major, maybe three major differentiators that separated WordPress from the rest from the rest of the pack. If you will. Um, you know, there&#8217;s a lot of great content management systems out there. You know, they all do the same thing or try to do people the same. They try to make it easy for people to publish information onto the web and make it easy for others to consume it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>J.J. Toothman (00:32:35) &#8211; But the differentiators from WordPress versus the other CMS that we were looking at were number one. A lot of again, it had a lot of it had to do with the ecosystem. WordPress was the only CMS that had real time analysis tools around SEO. So and accessibility to kind of try to improve those situations before the point of publishing. So Yoast is the obvious example. So Yoast, you know, we&#8217;ve all been exposed to Yoast. Yoast allows you to allows the content creator user to be authoring and editing content and getting some real time analysis about how friendly or compatible, whatever the term you want to use it is before the point of publish. There&#8217;s accessibility tools out there that do the same things that are kind of integrated within the WordPress Admin WordPress dashboard that allow that content creator user to like, you know, when it&#8217;s in draft format to analyze. Do I have accessibly accessible content that I&#8217;m about to publish in here and make live other CMS didn&#8217;t have that baked in. You know, there&#8217;s WordPress plugins that do these things.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>J.J. Toothman (00:33:51) &#8211; Um, we could even, we even have the ability to prevent publishing until certain excessively thresholds and SEO optimization thresholds are met. That was really, really attractive. All the most of the majority of the other solutions are you publish it first it&#8217;s live and then you can go back and check it and then you kind of have to retrofit it. I&#8217;ve been working in enterprises enough to know that that doesn&#8217;t happen once it&#8217;s published, Once it&#8217;s out there, people are generally going to move on. They&#8217;re not going to do the analysis of like, All right, how do I go back and improve this thing? So you really got to you really got to catch those things early and often. Um, you know, up front in the, in the content publishing lifecycle. So that was one of the big differentiators was that and that again, that&#8217;s all a product of the WordPress ecosystem and the innovation that comes out of that ecosystem. The other one was just kind of like the resources around this. So we all, you know, you can take for a grain of salt like, you know, the the whole thing about, you know, WordPress powers, 40% of the web, you know, that kind of stuff.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>J.J. Toothman (00:34:57) &#8211; But there is some byproduct of that. And that is there&#8217;s a lot of people using it. There&#8217;s a lot of people building it. There&#8217;s a lot of people developing on it. There&#8217;s a lot of people extending on. There&#8217;s a lot of knowledge being shared around that. One of the things I did was I went in the stack overflow and compared WordPress with other CMS&#8217;s and just being like, How many conversations are happening around this thing, you know, that we&#8217;re looking at? And it was, you know, what you expected, the ability for, you know, to be able to. Try to solve a problem by getting by by, you know, interfacing or sponging up knowledge that was already contributed back in some way, you know, via via StackOverflow or, you know, other places on the Web, other groups, Slack channels, etcetera, that exists in WordPress in a way that it doesn&#8217;t exist in these other, you know, CMS products. You know, the if you want to if you want to get developer knowledge around Adobe Experience Manager, you for for the most part there are some Adobe experience manager specialists out there, but for the most part you got to go to Adobe for it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>J.J. Toothman (00:36:02) &#8211; Um. Uh, you know, same thing with sorts. There&#8217;s not there&#8217;s not a huge community of sort site developers out there. So for a place like NASA, you know, resource acquisition becomes a problem. Like, where are they going to find talent for that? Yeah. And you know, again, WordPress, you know, kind of is head and shoulders above the rest in that area. Um, and then, you know, this whole concept of WordPress is for everyone to like that. That rang true in all this research too. Like it&#8217;s more than just developer community. There&#8217;s user communities out there that are also sharing their knowledge here. Um, you know, there&#8217;s all these kinds of like, there&#8217;s, there&#8217;s solutions for learning WordPress that are provided by the communities and multiple companies with the community that add a lot of value within the equals. So it&#8217;s not just like the software ecosystem, but it&#8217;s like, you know, the kind of service ecosystem to that exist within WordPress. Um, and then honestly, like, you know, portability matters to, um, you know, there&#8217;s, for the most part, like I really just wanted public sector to adopt open source.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>J.J. Toothman (00:37:11) &#8211; You know, that&#8217;s the first decision I want, I want them to do is just, just, you know, make an open source decision. And then you&#8217;ve done that. You know, you&#8217;re in a good you&#8217;re in a better place than picking a commercial, you know, bespoke solution. You know, And then, you know, once you get past that hurdle now, you know, the obvious open source can cannot exist. And you know, the user experience of WordPress and that whole concept of WordPress being for everyone and being considering everyone, depending on who you are, really rings true and is a differentiator as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cory Miller (00:37:50) &#8211; Well, that&#8217;s excellent. And that rings true. You know, I&#8217;m curious because as I talked to more enterprise agencies, all of you out there in the world interfacing with clients, with their needs, what they actually are trying to get done. That&#8217;s really, really great to hear and it&#8217;s reflective of the community. I think sometimes they&#8217;ve been in the community like you as long as we have.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cory Miller (00:38:10) &#8211; I take some of those things for granted. So I think that&#8217;s that&#8217;s excellent. Well, JJ, thanks so much for the time today. I know you just got back from a big trip and you&#8217;ve got work to pile out, but I appreciate you coming on the podcast and sharing your agency journey, and I look forward to our next conversation, sharing the good work you&#8217;re doing with WordPress in our world. That too.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>J.J. Toothman (00:38:31) &#8211; Corey Thanks for having me.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cory Miller (00:38:34) &#8211; All right. Thanks, everybody, for being here today.

Websites are now integral to modern business operations, and their value should be recognized and treated as essential as physical security measures.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Effective Client Communication</strong>: Clear and proactive communication with clients is crucial.

Managing client communication helps build trust and ensures a smoother working relationship.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Community Engagement and Personal Well-being</strong>: Engaging with the WordPress community and participating in events like WordCamps can be valuable for networking, knowledge sharing, and staying updated with industry trends.

Hey, everybody. Welcome back to Post Edits Draft. We&#8217;ve got another interview in our series on agency journeys. And I&#8217;m talking to a long time friend of mine, Rob Carnes, who has been very active in post. It&#8217;s been to a bunch of our meetups and I&#8217;m really excited to share his story today. So Rob, thanks for being on The Post podcast.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Rob Cairns (00:00:21) &#8211; My pleasure, Corey. Glad to be here.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cory Miller (00:00:24) &#8211; Well, Rob, let&#8217;s dive in. Tell us a little bit about yourself and your agency today. Name and what you do. What kind of work primarily you do for your clients.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Rob Cairns (00:00:34) &#8211; Okay, So my name is Rob Cairns. I&#8217;m in the greater Toronto area of Toronto, Ontario, Canada. I should tell you, before I got into running an agency, I have a very tech heavy background which a lot of agency owners don&#8217;t have. So I come out of an enterprise healthcare environment, doing servers, doing all kinds of cool stuff to support one of Toronto&#8217;s biggest hospitals.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Rob Cairns (00:00:58) &#8211; Before that I was actually an old time COBOL programmer. There&#8217;s probably a word that you haven&#8217;t heard in a long, long time, and I spent some time in the financial industry, so I&#8217;ve got a bit of a business background. And then I jumped into agency life because, you know, I always tell the story. I never planned to be in marketing because I had a marketing professor in school back in the 80s who came in the class, and her whole thing was, Oh, I&#8217;m good. I&#8217;m here because I want my summers off. And I said, I swore then in there I&#8217;d never be a marketer if you paid me money to. Well, I lied. So, yeah. And I run I run an agency that&#8217;s WordPress focused. A lot of it is WordPress security stuff right now and some builds and then a lot of email marketing and consulting these days. That&#8217;s kind of where I&#8217;m at.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cory Miller (00:01:50) &#8211; Yeah. And what&#8217;s your agency name?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Rob Cairns (00:01:53) &#8211; Stunning digital marketing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cory Miller (00:01:55) &#8211; And what&#8217;s the website for your.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Rob Cairns (00:01:58) &#8211; Digital marketing is the agency site and digital marketing.info is like my Linktree site. It&#8217;s got links to everything I do on the web and where you can find me.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cory Miller (00:02:09) &#8211; Excellent. Excellent. Well, I know as I&#8217;ve gotten to know you through some of the meetups, too, I hear more and more about the work you do, and it always impresses me. You&#8217;re like, Hey, is anybody worried about this particular update? And and I know you managed quite a few sites and it always I always like lean in when you talk about that because it&#8217;s at the heart of what a lot of agency work, particularly at post is that our agencies do is that beast of maintaining WordPress across multiple WordPress client sites. Well, great. Thank you for that. So tell me a little bit about how you got there. I heard a little preface of that, but I wanted to start out with where you are today. Um, and then talk about how you got there. That&#8217;s always the compelling part of these Journey series to me is what happened before.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cory Miller (00:02:59) &#8211; So this is today and then what? What&#8217;s a little snippet of how what led up to where you are today?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Rob Cairns (00:03:06) &#8211; So where I am today was kind of how I got there was us working in healthcare. I wasn&#8217;t happy, I&#8217;ll tell you that now. I was working probably 60 to 70 hours a week at the time. So this is going back 14 years ago was when we started and I was extremely unhappy and somebody said to me, So why don&#8217;t you just go? And I said, Well, I&#8217;ve been here 21 years, so if they want to get rid of me, it&#8217;s going to cost some lots of money to get rid of me. So let&#8217;s force the hand and see where it goes. Well, 14 years ago, my dad was sick with pancreatic cancer at the time he actually passed away July 8th, the anniversary that&#8217;s coming up. And they decided, knowing I was going to be taking some time off, they decided we need to we&#8217;re going to make some changes and you can go away.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Rob Cairns (00:03:56) &#8211; And at that point, I was already building WordPress websites on the side. So I just kind of transitioned to what I was doing on the side full time. Now here&#8217;s where it got interesting. I decided really quickly only building the website, it&#8217;s only part of getting it out there. You still got a market that site and you got to do it properly. So I made a decision then and there. I was going to build a full stack marketing agency. I&#8217;ve taken some courses, a lot of courses. One of my mentors in this space is a gentleman by the name of Paul Tobey, who I&#8217;m founder of. Paul. Toby&#8217;s actually the father of Adrian Toby, the founder of Groundhog, who you know. So that&#8217;s.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cory Miller (00:04:40) &#8211; Love.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Rob Cairns (00:04:40) &#8211; Adrian Yeah, love Adrian, Love. His dad saw his dad in January, actually, and we sat in his house and listened to him play some jazz tunes for us where we were visiting and and then transitioned in and at one time was offering all kinds of services and then just realized some of these are just don&#8217;t want to do so I just kind of niche down and got out of what I didn&#8217;t want to do so.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cory Miller (00:05:10) &#8211; Got you. So how long ago did you go? Full time with the business?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Rob Cairns (00:05:16) &#8211; 14 years ago.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cory Miller (00:05:18) &#8211; 14 years ago. Okay. That&#8217;s awesome. We were going strong about the same time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Rob Cairns (00:05:22) &#8211; Yeah, about same time. And you. And you and I connected, I think the first time about 14 years ago when I was in the headway community. And you were running the items community. And you&#8217;d be proud to know two of the products in my security stack back up by the in 19 security are still there to this day so.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cory Miller (00:05:40) &#8211; Oh that&#8217;s fantastic to hear. Well, okay, So I&#8217;m really curious. Was there a point when you were like, doing this on the side? What was that juncture when you&#8217;re like, okay, I&#8217;m going to do this full time? A lot of the stories we hear, I hear in It&#8217;s My Own is some event. Something helped kind of catalyze the process to become a full time entrepreneur. And so I&#8217;m curious. So not happy, of course. And then, hey, I think you might have mentioned this just a second ago, but I want to make sure I&#8217;m clear on it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cory Miller (00:06:13) &#8211; So was there event that kind of like, okay, I&#8217;m doing this full time, this is the only thing I&#8217;m doing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Rob Cairns (00:06:18) &#8211; So my as I say, my dad was battling pancreatic cancer at the time. Oh, right. Yeah. I went on three weeks vacation after I was on the corporate project, number one, and amassing overtime like nothing. And I walked back in on a Monday morning. I got a call from the director&#8217;s secretary at 10 a.m. and say, Director won&#8217;t see you in a boardroom at 3:00. And the boardroom was not the normal boardroom for meetings. So I just kind of put my feet up and said, okay, I know how this day&#8217;s going to play out. Welcome back from vacation for me. And believe it or not, I actually shipped everything personal home from work at lunchtime in a cab because I saw the writing on the wall. I&#8217;d seen it on the wall for a while. Yeah. Then I get, um, I get called in and the director says, Do you know why you&#8217;re here? I said, So you&#8217;re going to let me go, so let&#8217;s just get it over with.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Rob Cairns (00:07:16) &#8211; And the h.r. Manager turned to me and said, how do you how do you feel about all this? And my response at the time was, my lawyer will tell you at 9:00 tomorrow morning. Now you&#8217;re like no other comment.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cory Miller (00:07:27) &#8211; Now at this time, you were already doing things on the side, though, right? Yeah, I think that&#8217;s important to note in the story because, you know, some of these events that happen, but you were already kind of testing the waters, building some kind of side hustle side gig on the side. So you didn&#8217;t just, you know, jump out into the ether. You had something kind of built up. Were you doing work for like client? I mean, friends? How did the the side gig kind of start parallel to that side gig?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Rob Cairns (00:07:59) &#8211; Actually, it&#8217;s really interesting you ask that question. Being in tech, I&#8217;m like a resource in my family and you can appreciate that. So I did go to the let&#8217;s send an email to let&#8217;s ask the question.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Rob Cairns (00:08:13) &#8211; And I actually got fed up with family, believe it or not, and I wrote a website at that time was HTML and said, by the way, here&#8217;s all the family pictures from the event last week because I was also the manager of all that digital stuff. And by the way, here&#8217;s links to all the questions you guys asked me and nobody&#8217;s allowed to ask me a question until you go to these links and and actually do your own homework. So that was my start into domains and all of that and web stuff. And the other thing that started it was this is going back to the days of dial and dialing Internet providers, if we remember those days. Yep. And trauma, they were a dime a dozen. So I used to switch providers, i.e. email services more than most people because I get fed up with one dial in provider and I cancel. I go to another one, I cancel, I go to another one, I cancel. So I finally said, Forget this, I&#8217;m going to register a domain which I still have to this day.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Rob Cairns (00:09:15) &#8211; And then that was kind of my foray in. And then after doing static sites, I realized WordPress was the way to go and that&#8217;s what kind of opened the door.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cory Miller (00:09:24) &#8211; So what was your introduction to WordPress? What kind of time period did you start using?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Rob Cairns (00:09:28) &#8211; WordPress would have been about 16, 15 years ago. 16 years ago?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cory Miller (00:09:32) &#8211; Yeah, right. Right. In its first early heyday for sure. That&#8217;s about the same time I got started with WordPress, this cool platform that you didn&#8217;t have to manage with all these HTML top software and updated 100 pages you could do with one click. Essentially this concept of content management system was really, really crazy and awesome.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Rob Cairns (00:09:53) &#8211; We all remember the famous five minute WordPress install where our our hosting providers didn&#8217;t have a one click installer like stop flashes or any of them. We had to do it ourselves, right?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cory Miller (00:10:05) &#8211; And yeah, we did it. I mean, I&#8217;m trying to remember when I did that, if it was FTP, you know, putting it on the server.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cory Miller (00:10:14) &#8211; Yeah, I&#8217;m trying to think back about that. I use soft tactless quite a bit in the early days, but that was magical back then. If you think about it, it&#8217;s like I want the ability to do build a website and I don&#8217;t have to learn too many technical logistics. I remember googling. What does FTP mean? That was one of our first post that I themes because I was like, if I have this question, I bet you a bunch of other people have this question. But yeah, WordPress made it easy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Rob Cairns (00:10:40) &#8211; Yeah. I have to tell you a funny story. You appreciate being over it. I think so. I had a client years ago. It was Australian, one of my first big clients, and he didn&#8217;t see the spending the money on something like backup buddy. So the silly client came back to me and said, So write me the documentation process of tobacco and restore a website menu and document it out. And the story goes that the cost to him paying for that documentation at the time would have cost him more than a yearly license for backup money.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Rob Cairns (00:11:12) &#8211; Well, even or not. So needless to say, he became a backup buddy. Pretty convert pretty quickly. Corey.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cory Miller (00:11:20) &#8211; So. Well, okay, so you go full time with the agency starting to do on work. I know somewhere in there was like, Hey, there&#8217;s more to just the actual website build. There&#8217;s marketing different parts around the website. Um, as you look back, you know, 15 years now, what were some of the catalytic events that help you in your agency, personal professional, WordPress, all these things. If you look back where like 3 or 4 of the things that really made the difference in your agency to where you&#8217;re now, I know you&#8217;ve been doing this a long time. I know you&#8217;ve been able to have freedom of life to do different things in your life as part of the business part of WordPress, which is always the magic, I think, WordPress. But if you look back, what are those couple of things that kind of stand out?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Rob Cairns (00:12:06) &#8211; Um, a couple of things.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Rob Cairns (00:12:07) &#8211; One is I come from a family of entrepreneurs, so my mother is 78 years old, still alive and still selling houses, believe it or not. As a real estate agent, my aunt who passed away at 92, was one of the top real estate brokers for Century 21 in the Farmington, Detroit area for many, many years. First successful. I come from a family who&#8217;s done business on their own, so that helps. My father was a CFO for an insurance broker, so that helps. That helped install some money sense into me and some business sense into me. I&#8217;m also a lifelong learner. So you and I have talked over the years about how much reading I do or how much listening to other podcasts. I do believe it or not, my own podcast is not on my podcast player backdrop. I&#8217;m busy listening to everybody else&#8217;s because think you got to get a variety of point. And then kind of just people along the way. People like yourself. People like Paul. Toby Paul was a big catalyst for giving me credit and saying, you know, more than like 75% of the world.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Rob Cairns (00:13:21) &#8211; Just go after it. So Paul was really good for me around mindset more than just technical stuff, so that was good. And then things like in my life recognizing and you and I have had this conversation about mental health challenges and the whole pearls around that. You&#8217;ve been through it. I&#8217;ve been through it. We&#8217;ve talked about it very candidly together over the years. That has helped. Am probably. 200% more mental health. Healthy today in my 50s and was in my 30s. I would say that, you know.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cory Miller (00:13:58) &#8211; I think I want to say ditto. I think I think so.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Rob Cairns (00:14:02) &#8211; And then surrounding yourself with the right people and people like yourself, people like post others group people like, you know, people outside of the post group, people you can go to and say, Hey, I just need an ear or, Hey, I&#8217;m stuck on something technical. I should know doing that. And then kind of. A big part of all this was deciding a number of years ago that I&#8217;m such a security junkie and I always was, even when I was in health care, and I need to dive into the security space and put my time and money there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Rob Cairns (00:14:38) &#8211; And that was a big part of it, too. And that&#8217;s how that came to birth. You mentioned, I imagine, websites as of yesterday&#8217;s count 418, believe it or not, just from an update in security perspective and growing by the day. So.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cory Miller (00:14:53) &#8211; It&#8217;s it&#8217;s for sure become a thing in a good part of our industry and community that there&#8217;s agencies like yours and I&#8217;ve talked to a lot that that are recognized WordPress is awesome. There&#8217;s a lot of things that go into it as far as keeping those things updated. So somebody goes, Oh, I built it, you know, I built the baseball field, Field of Dreams. It&#8217;s there. Cool. Everybody&#8217;s going to come to it. There&#8217;s two sides of the coin that&#8217;s really interesting with your story. One is that updates security. Part of it got to keep the field maintained. The other side is the marketing part. I found this fascinating because you&#8217;ve got this to blend of marketing and the really the maintenance said that includes this big topic called security.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Rob Cairns (00:15:37) &#8211; Yep, it&#8217;s true. And like one of the biggest things I think agency owners don&#8217;t do well is they don&#8217;t manage their own mailing lists, let alone their client mailing lists. And email marketing has become one of my strengths over the years and think that is a big deal because the only thing you really own is your website. In your mailing list. Everything is kind of what we call rented land or other people&#8217;s land in the rules change by the day and it gets to be awful.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cory Miller (00:16:07) &#8211; So yeah, yeah, it&#8217;s, it&#8217;s interesting. I&#8217;ve talked to a lot of people. I think a lot of the WordPress community saw one thing from my work at things, but I go, you know, one want to know the key to what we built. There&#8217;s a lot of keys, right? But one of the big keys, especially marketing, was email marketing. And I love how you said website, what you really own, the website and email address. You don&#8217;t even own the rankings. You got to keep working on those things.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cory Miller (00:16:32) &#8211; You got to you don&#8217;t even necessarily on the traffic. You got to keep working on those things. But when you have the what click for me with email marketing, was this old school, now old school concept of direct marketing when people used to go door to door and still do of course, to sell something to that person directly. And I think that was when it clicked for me is email is direct marketing where I don&#8217;t control the algorithms and whatever tech billionaire is going to buy another of the social media platforms. But if I consistently build I was actually talking to entrepreneur last week about this, just she&#8217;s just getting started with the physical product. And I said, Hey, you know, all the jazz and the sexiness is out on the social media platforms. However, it&#8217;s a great way to get started, push them, funnel them into an email where you can still to date in 2023, directly market. It still works, but so many are adverse to it or don&#8217;t do the work to keep up their keep up, grow, maintain their email lists and use them properly.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Rob Cairns (00:17:37) &#8211; And to segment them properly. Mean the big issue is. So I&#8217;ll give you an example. I have an email list that&#8217;s running about 7500 active right now. I&#8217;ve probably got, if you count people have an open stuff in like the last 60 days and probably closer to 1200. So the key is not to send emails to your host, send them to the 7500 that are active and then every six months touch base with the other people once in a while, like because honestly, that&#8217;s waste of time and money. Like don&#8217;t put your emphasis there, but you segment your list and figure out what people want from you and who&#8217;s going to open stuff. And as a result, on that 7500, I run an open rate of about listeners about 62% on a regular basis. Which is incredible.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cory Miller (00:18:29) &#8211; Yeah, indeed. And it all takes work. Websites, take work, emails take a work to properly do it well. So. So you know, a couple of the things I&#8217;m interested in. The last 15 years or so you&#8217;ve been doing, this is what you&#8217;ve seen kind of transition the evolution of WordPress you know, from and websites within that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cory Miller (00:18:53) &#8211; So you know how WordPress has gone in the last 15 years. Where do you think it is now? Where do you think it&#8217;s going in the future, what your clients are seeing and value in as part of having a great web presence? And I&#8217;m curious your thoughts on those two things. So the underlying technology has grown 15 years. We just celebrated 20th anniversary of WordPress, which is just fascinating to me. Um, and then, you know, this, this changing perception, I think growing, valuing perception of websites, the value of having a WordPress type website.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Rob Cairns (00:19:29) &#8211; So there&#8217;s a couple of things. When we all started with WordPress, you and I, it was basically a blogging platform and now we&#8217;re building these whole robust membership sites, e-commerce sites, we&#8217;re building all this stuff and it&#8217;s incredible. And people say, Oh, why don&#8217;t you go to an e-commerce platform? Well, I have to tell you, I picked up the paper today, this morning before we jumped on this call. Corey and Shopify, who we all know is one of the big e-commerce products, is in trouble with the Canadian government because they refuse to hand over shopping records to the tax people so they can go after individuals.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Rob Cairns (00:20:10) &#8211; And the cool thing about WordPress is that&#8217;s all self contained. So as we get into this privacy era, everything&#8217;s within your dashboard and you can even buy marketing solutions like Groundhog Adrian, Toby or Fluent CRM, another one that resides right inside that dashboard which protects your privacy and puts you in control. And I think that&#8217;s the whole thing about WordPress. The other big thing I&#8217;ve seen is a big change in the hosting space. And you&#8217;ll agree with me, um, what&#8217;s old is good and what hosting companies have reinvented themselves in the last while. And two I like to point out to is one over at New fold and we both of us have a mutual friend there in the name of Dave Ryan at Neufeld. So Dave and his team, I&#8217;ve had many dealings with them. They were the old endurance and they came out of that. And they&#8217;re trying to reinvent themselves by running around and buying plug ins like they bought Yoast and they bought it and doing things like that. And then important for new fold, they&#8217;ve become more community aware than they&#8217;ve ever become before.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Rob Cairns (00:21:19) &#8211; So this was not the idea of eight years ago or nine years ago. I can guarantee that. And they&#8217;ve changed. And then you take somebody like her friends up at GoDaddy and, you know, I know that team pretty well for work I&#8217;ve done, and they&#8217;ve reinvented themselves. They&#8217;ve come out of the ashes of the Danica Patrick ads, as we call them. Remember those? Could you see a sexist ad like that flying in today&#8217;s society? I don&#8217;t think so.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cory Miller (00:21:50) &#8211; No. We&#8217;ve evolved past that for sure for for better.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Rob Cairns (00:21:55) &#8211; But they&#8217;ve also reinvented themselves. And then even in a hosting space, you got companies like Liquid Web and WP Engine and Cloud, and then you&#8217;ve got companies that were leaders that have kind of dropped off. And a company I throw into a group like that is Siteground think, you know. Ten years. Five years ago, they were great. And then somethings kind of happened. So things go cyclical. Um, in terms of the technology more, it&#8217;s worth mentioning where we&#8217;ve gone.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Rob Cairns (00:22:25) &#8211; So we&#8217;ve gone from coding and WordPress with plugins to page builders and your team and I think this is one of the first with, with your builder product, right? And themes to, to build sites. And then we got into things like headway, which we all know the story of what happened there and they were part of their problems. They were miles ahead of their time and just not adapted. And then we got into the traditional page builders like the Beaver Builders, the Yeah, Elementor, the bricks, that kind of stuff, which is prominent now. And now we&#8217;re headed to this magical thing called blocks. And you know, there&#8217;s a couple block ecosystems. The one I use is cadence. I&#8217;ve been all in with Cadence for a couple of years now. So there&#8217;s evolution, that spot. And I think we&#8217;re we&#8217;re starting to see more is WordPress is becoming more than just a publishing platform. Automattic owns Tumblr, Automattic owns pocket casts, one of the biggest pocket podcast players out there. They own the day One journal, which is a journaling app, um, would encourage anybody out there who needs a journaling product to go get it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Rob Cairns (00:23:45) &#8211; It&#8217;s worth every penny of it, like honestly. So they&#8217;re trying to democratize that whole, the whole solution. So, so a lot that&#8217;s gone on in 20. Um.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cory Miller (00:23:59) &#8211; Yeah, there&#8217;s a whole history there and everything you talked about. I think what stands out was the hosting industry. It&#8217;s definitely evolved, grown and a lot of money has come into WordPress hosting space in particular. You talk about new Fold in Endurance, for instance, like it&#8217;s turned over, been sold and bought so many acquisitions in the space and for good reason, because WordPress is a great platform for millions of people to build their website on. So but you know, there&#8217;s a trend there too, which is you talked about the reinvention and kind of coming out of stuff. What I&#8217;ve seen in 15 years plus years or so is. Yeah, it starts out good. Trying to claim her to get new customers. New clients, show them, you know, help them with their stuff. And it seems a lot of cyclical ness of like, okay, they reached this point where now they&#8217;re trying to really all the hosting companies, I would say, should make a profit.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cory Miller (00:25:02) &#8211; But then there&#8217;s a swath that like, okay, increasingly trying to make it more profitable to understand part of business. However, then you see customer service and support start to kind of fade with some of that and then you get this whole, okay, they&#8217;re going down and then going up. And I&#8217;ve I&#8217;m not going to name the names, but there&#8217;s a lot there where you see the cyclical up and down of that hosting side, which isn&#8217;t always healthy for WordPress either. I get it as a business part. What they need to do for their shareholders, partners, all that kind of stuff. But it&#8217;s definitely changed from like 2008 when I think this was on a shared hosting plan for like, I don&#8217;t know, $5 a month or $10 a month at like HostGator. And it&#8217;s I&#8217;ve kind of bemoaned it some because what the effect now is the experience for the WordPress user, those people that are your clients that are using their website and there&#8217;s that up and down. They&#8217;ve had to ride some of that and it&#8217;s always not good thing for the health of the ecosystem.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Rob Cairns (00:26:06) &#8211; It&#8217;s true. And the other thing I should add to to this discussion is I think the team up at Automattic, the parent company of WordPress, has been much more receptive to comments, suggestions than ever before. And I know some people don&#8217;t feel that way, but I think we&#8217;re in really good hands with Josepha being the executive director of the WordPress project, you know, and things like that. And I know on the Gutenberg side I&#8217;ve gotten to know Matthias Venture, The Gutenberg lead a little bit and, and people like our friends Polly Hack or people like Jessica Frick over at Percival, which is an automatic company. People like that have put us in pretty good hands, frankly.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cory Miller (00:26:52) &#8211; Yeah, my personal opinion is automatic has long term commitment to the industry and I&#8217;m really proud to have them as sponsors a lot of automatic and post status and for good reason. But you know a long term commitment to like they have had the opportunity for many years to really really monetize what WordPress is and have held back. I think this is only my personal opinion.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cory Miller (00:27:18) &#8211; No facts really share other&#8217;s leadership there. But get go have had a long term commitment because they believe in open source, they believe in the open web and the ecosystem is healthy. When you have a diverse set of people offering services and products to that, so you get great performance. Obviously they know WordPress inside and out and then the support and those are the things that have that kind of wane over time. In any hosting company that I&#8217;ve been, that I&#8217;ve been around, I&#8217;ve had I&#8217;ve been a customer at many of the ones you talked about had clients and friends at many of the ones that you talked about. And but the consistency, I think, is what matters overall. So I agree with you. Agree. Um, okay. So we&#8217;ve talked about a whole lot of stuff. Now I want to talk I want to ask this specific question related to your clients. What are you hearing from your clients about WordPress, how they&#8217;re using their websites? Because I love talking to our agency owners because tip of the spear for me is the people out there doing the work.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cory Miller (00:28:20) &#8211; For those people using WordPress, they might not even know or care that there&#8217;s this open source platform underneath it all. But what are you hearing from your clients about what WordPress and working with the websites?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Rob Cairns (00:28:32) &#8211; Yeah, there&#8217;s a couple things. I don&#8217;t think my clients care what&#8217;s under the hood. So by that mean they don&#8217;t care if it&#8217;s a WordPress site, if it&#8217;s a custom site, if it&#8217;s something else, as long as it gives them the results they want. So one of the things I&#8217;ve been pushing in the community for the last ten years is don&#8217;t sell the solution. Sell what it brings you. I&#8217;m a big one. Outcome or something, not how you get there. And if anybody doesn&#8217;t believe that, I suggest you go look up a guy by the name of Simon Sinek. Start with why is his book and find his Ted talk and watch it and watch it again. So sell the the what you get out of it. So that&#8217;s the first one. I also think clients hate to say are dropping the security ball big time right now.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Rob Cairns (00:29:21) &#8211; I&#8217;m working on a site right now where the client couldn&#8217;t find their backup that they were sending to a cloud drive for six days and they took them six days to find out where they put that backup. So one of the things I find with my clients is you have to help them manage their digital assets or their digital stuff, and even more so in small businesses. What happens if the business owner gets run over by a truck tomorrow? What happens if he dies tomorrow? Do you have a succession plan for your business? Do you know how to handle that? Most people don&#8217;t. So that&#8217;s a problem. And then the other thing is, I think a lot of people flock to WordPress because frankly, what are we powering now? 45% in the Internet, 50% somewhere in there. And I think that alone is a selling thing. That&#8217;s attraction. Thing is WordPress is open source. It can&#8217;t be secure the security holes every month. Well, guess what? Microsoft Windows plugs security holes on the first Tuesday every month called Patch Tuesday.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Rob Cairns (00:30:27) &#8211; And the whole business world runs on Windows more than that. Right. And they&#8217;re still plugging holes. Security is a trust factor, not a it happened or it didn&#8217;t happen.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cory Miller (00:30:37) &#8211; So I like that because security is a non-essential part of the digital our digital world, particularly our Internet, it&#8217;s a part of it. The real question is how are the people or companies behind that making sure it&#8217;s always secure. I remember talking to a security expert. I don&#8217;t know, it&#8217;s been eight years now and they said it&#8217;s not a matter this is one that just all they do is security and they go, it&#8217;s not a matter of if we&#8217;ll get hacked, it&#8217;s when and what we&#8217;re doing continually. And I go, that&#8217;s part of the digital age. That&#8217;s where we&#8217;re at. So I love that emphasis from your point. It&#8217;s just not when it&#8217;s if. And what are you doing in the meantime to help proactively do that?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Rob Cairns (00:31:19) &#8211; And I&#8217;ll take that one more. Corey I have a saying in my business that&#8217;s not if you&#8217;ll be hacked, it&#8217;s when you&#8217;ll be hacked.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Rob Cairns (00:31:25) &#8211; And how do you recover where I take it? So I kind of look at this mess I&#8217;ve been dealing with, and a big part of the problem was the client didn&#8217;t have a site updated, the client didn&#8217;t have the PHP version updated, the client couldn&#8217;t find the backup. You see where this is going? Yep. And it&#8217;s we got to take care of those assets and we got to treat them like the they&#8217;re important. So that&#8217;s that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cory Miller (00:31:52) &#8211; Just like you would lock your car or your house at night or your car if you&#8217;re driving into the supermarket or the grocery store, whatever that is, you&#8217;d lock your car because, you know, you do those things. We don&#8217;t even think about those things. They&#8217;re so embedded now and we need to be doing that. I love this message. We need to be doing that with our digital assets.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Rob Cairns (00:32:11) &#8211; We&#8217;re a mutual friend of ours. You know, Kathy&#8217;s N over at K very well. And I turned to Cathy in January and said, I&#8217;m going to make you a prediction.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Rob Cairns (00:32:20) &#8211; And she said, Oh, I don&#8217;t like your predictions are usually right. And I said, I&#8217;m going to declare 2023 as a year of the vulnerability, the first week of January. And that was coming out of the whole LastPass debacle that happened. And we all know about that one. And sure enough, and I think it&#8217;s partially awareness, but I think there&#8217;s a multitude of factors and it&#8217;s kind of played out that way. The other thing I&#8217;m hearing from clients is clients don&#8217;t realize that websites have to have a budget attached to them for their business. So marketing budget and they say, Oh, we do it in house. And I say, okay, so what&#8217;s your hourly rate worth? Oh, it&#8217;s worth $40 an hour. How many hours a month do you do? Oh five. So your marketing budget is 40 times five. So that&#8217;s the other thing. Business has got to take this stuff seriously and start to budget for.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cory Miller (00:33:17) &#8211; I love that Social Security and then budget, and that&#8217;s the mindset.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cory Miller (00:33:21) &#8211; So, you know, a lot of the conversations I&#8217;ve been having is the recognition from clients that their website is not just valuable, it&#8217;s an integral part of how they do business. Covid accelerated a lot of that. I think it&#8217;s like, Hey, we got so many physical location, bricks and mortar type businesses realizing when you can&#8217;t actually see a person face to face. So I have two way of a way to be able to do business. So I love that it&#8217;s integral. So security, part of life budgeting, you need to budget for it just like you would any other part of your businesses in the essential part of your business. And so many of the agency owners have talked to here at Post Status, they the clients are recognizing that it&#8217;s in some of the instances, I would say more like a B2B. They see it&#8217;s at a very, very valuable part of their overall sales strategy and they value it deeply. Some run their whole operations or half operations, you know, and items and post those two, we run our whole operation through online space so it feels foreign.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cory Miller (00:34:26) &#8211; But that&#8217;s not the way business is traditionally. It&#8217;s, you know, you go to a store, you travel, you walk, you ride in a horse and buggy or a car to get to. Things have changed. And that seems like what I&#8217;m hearing, too, is that mindset needs a change of like this is all a part of business domains, websites, all the platforms you might be on, all as important as that door that opens up into your business.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Rob Cairns (00:34:51) &#8211; 100% and then look at the criticality of it. So, for example, if you&#8217;re an e-commerce site that&#8217;s making 30,000 US a day profit, then you need a different level of support than somebody that&#8217;s got a brochure site that is out there just to be the face of their business. So you got to think about things like that, too. Very much so.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cory Miller (00:35:12) &#8211; Okay, so security and budget. Anything else on your mind about when you when you&#8217;re working with clients and how they&#8217;re valuing their websites? Any perspectives you have to share there too.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Rob Cairns (00:35:22) &#8211; I think a lot of clients in this day and age are unrealistic and think that&#8217;s the world we live in. So it&#8217;s a very much an I want it now world. It&#8217;s I want it yesterday. There&#8217;s no patience out there like to tell you I don&#8217;t think clients are any different.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cory Miller (00:35:39) &#8211; So. Yeah. So it&#8217;s the physical part of business, which I have a friend that has a restaurant supply business and I understand how like when you&#8217;re, you know, stove or cooktop is down, they can&#8217;t sell. And then now that okay, got to have it now. And that service side is pretty intense for them. I can see that now being applied to the business is where they see it as essential. I want to say that&#8217;s a good part, but when it comes with some mindset change of okay, we need to be able to budget for that and pay for that and, and knowing like in the middle of the night or whatever it is to have that kind of service turnaround is not always possible or realistic.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Rob Cairns (00:36:27) &#8211; And communication is a big part of it too. I don&#8217;t think some clients communicate well, don&#8217;t think some agencies communicate well. Like, for example, I&#8217;m going on vacation next Wednesday. Yay me, I&#8217;ve already sent out an email to my entire client was saying, By the way, the only thing I&#8217;ll deal with while I&#8217;m away is a website down issue. Everything else sits till I get home and just tell them upfront. Now, they might not like to hear it, but that&#8217;s you&#8217;re allowed to take time off. You&#8217;re allowed to recharge.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cory Miller (00:36:58) &#8211; The good communication, getting ahead of it to manage those expectations? Yeah, absolutely vital. All right, Rob. Well, anything else you want to share that you&#8217;re excited about, that you&#8217;re working on or doing?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Rob Cairns (00:37:10) &#8211; I think the big thing is the security side of it. Think, think. We just got to be aware and and make sure you&#8217;re aware and if and if anybody needs help agencies otherwise reach out, be glad to help them and be involved in the community.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Rob Cairns (00:37:25) &#8211; That&#8217;s a big part of what you and I do. You do not repost status. As you know, I co-manage a large LinkedIn group with Courtney Robertson. I&#8217;ve got a podcast that&#8217;s, you know, it&#8217;s good for business awareness, but it&#8217;s also good for the community too. So get involved. The community. Somebody if you can go to a word camp, go says the guy who&#8217;s got no time to go to work. Camps right now have not been to a five check by I missed word camp Buffalo Oh boy did I take stuff for not being on that one because that was a that&#8217;s an hour and a half away. I didn&#8217;t go to Montclair this weekend because, again, I&#8217;ve got conflicts. And the other thing is, look after you and your family and look after how you feel. Look after your health. Because if you don&#8217;t do that, you can&#8217;t run your business. So keep that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cory Miller (00:38:14) &#8211; Absolutely. Well, thanks, Rob, for being on post staff.

The feature was <a href=\"https://equalizedigital.com/nasa-funds-development-of-front-end-highlighting-feature-for-equalize-digital-accessibility-checker/\">funded</a> by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), through Equalize Digital&#8217;s consulting work on the new NASA websites.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>NASA recently launched the <a href=\"https://beta.nasa.gov/\">beta version</a> of its WordPress-powered flagship site, which WordCamp US attendees may hear about next week during the team&#8217;s sessions, including Friday&#8217;s keynote address: <a href=\"https://us.wordcamp.org/2023/session/friday-keynote/\">For All Userkind: NASA Web Modernization and WordPress</a> and another presentation titled <a href=\"https://us.wordcamp.org/2023/session/hands-on-with-nasas-new-digital-platform/\">Hands on with NASA’s new digital platform.</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Equalize Digital was contracted to perform accessibility testing, user testing with screen reader users, and provide accessibility governance recommendations.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;As part of the contract for those services, they also contracted us to develop this feature for the plugin,&#8221; Equalize Digital CEO Amber Hinds said. &#8220;They have an enterprise license but we decided in collaboration with them that we would make it a feature in the free plugin so everyone could benefit, not a paid-only feature.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;They were actually really interested in that because it&#8217;s part of their mission to give back to humanity.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Prior to developing the frontend highlighting feature, the accessibility checker plugin only had reports inside the post edit screen, with output that is nearly indecipherable for less technical users who are not accustomed to reading HTML.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<img width=\"1493\" height=\"709\" src=\"https://149611589.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/screenshot-3.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-147988\" />\n\n\n\n<p>The new frontend highlighting feature makes the accessibility report&#8217;s output far more approachable for users who may not be developers. It puts a &#8220;view on page&#8221; link next to each issue found in the report, which brings users to the frontend where the element in question is highlighted with a dashed pink box. It also displays a panel that explains the issue in a way that is easier to understand as well as how to fix it.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<img width=\"1800\" height=\"1053\" src=\"https://149611589.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Accessibility-Checker-Front-End-Highlighting-on-NASA.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-147987\" />\n\n\n\n<p>The report in the admin has been updated as well so that it&#8217;s easier to read. A new image column displays any images related to issues and the Actions column includes a &#8220;View on Page&#8221; link leading to the issue highlighted on the frontend. </p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<img width=\"2640\" height=\"1710\" src=\"https://149611589.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-2.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-147991\" />\n\n\n\n<p>Hind said her team is working on making the tool more friendly to content creators and not just a development tool. The plugin will stay on the NASA website to help their team as they add and edit content over time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;In the future, we&#8217;re planning to add the ability to jump to the element in the block editor as well,&#8221; Hinds said. &#8220;(That&#8217;s slightly tricky because we scan the whole page, not just the content area so we have to exclude elements created by other parts of the editor or theme.)&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Thanks to NASA&#8217;s funding, the new frontend highlighting feature is available to users on the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/accessibility-checker/\">free version of the plugin on WordPress.org</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Our goal is to make accessibility testing easier for every WordPress user, not just developers,” Equalize Digital CEO Amber Hinds said. “Accessibility Checker was developed to include a robust free version with this in mind. We want to make building websites that work for people with disabilities standard practice and were excited to work with NASA to make accessibility testing reports easier for non-developers to understand and take action on. Adding this feature to the free plugin was a no-brainer for us. We’re looking forward to seeing more WordPress website owners finding and fixing accessibility problems on their websites.”</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Fri, 18 Aug 2023 21:00:14 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:42;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:74:\"Do The Woo Community: Woo AgencyChat Live with Ash Shaw and Mitch Callahan\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:28:\"https://dothewoo.io/?p=76066\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:64:\"https://dothewoo.io/woo-agencychat-live-ash-shaw-mitch-callahan/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:410:\"<p>Join Ash Shaw from LightSpeed and Mitch Callahan from Saucal as they share insights from their WooCommerce agencies. </p>\n<p>&gt;&gt; The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://dothewoo.io/woo-agencychat-live-ash-shaw-mitch-callahan/\">Woo AgencyChat Live with Ash Shaw and Mitch Callahan</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://dothewoo.io\">Do the Woo - a WooCommerce Builder Community</a>	.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Fri, 18 Aug 2023 10:31:43 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:5:\"BobWP\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:43;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:93:\"WPTavern: WordPress Community Summit Travel Fund Contributes $48K in Assistance for Attendees\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:30:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=147963\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:103:\"https://wptavern.com/wordpress-community-summit-travel-fund-contributes-48k-in-assistance-for-attendees\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:2052:\"<p>This year&#8217;s WordCamp US includes a Community Summit, an invitation-only contributor-focused event that will take place prior to the main conference on August 22-23, 2023, in National Harbor, Washington, DC. It will be the first summit in six years, since the last one was held in Paris, France in 2017.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Historically, the summit has offered contributors the rare opportunity to hold in-person discussions on important topics across teams. In order to ensure the gathering is diverse and inclusive, previous community summit organizers have included a travel assistance program to remove the financial barriers of attending.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The 2023 Community Summit travel fund is <a href=\"https://communitysummit.wordcamp.org/2023/about-the-community-summit-travel-fund/\">providing $48,000 in travel assistance</a>, thanks to a group of sponsors that includes Automattic, A2 Hosting, Elementor, and Weglot.

Alex Stine, a fully blind individual contributor who has been working with the WordPress Accessibility team since 2016, is the first recipient of the funds designated for the fellowship.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>WPCC reports that the fellowship received donations from 59 individuals and organizations that want to support the cause of improving the open source project&#8217;s accessibility. The organization uses <a href=\"https://opencollective.com/thewpcc\">Open Collective</a> as the fiscal sponsor for its 501(c)3 status, enabling donations to be classified as charitable giving. All donations coming into the organization are transparent and publicly documented. </p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<img width=\"1906\" height=\"1180\" src=\"https://149611589.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Screen-Shot-2023-08-17-at-5.43.37-PM.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-147952\" />\n\n\n\n<p>The fellowship provides Stine with five paid contribution hours per week for six months, which allows him to continue his work on <a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/search?q=alexstine\">accessibility reviews and patches in WordPress core</a>. It includes a travel stipend for WordCamp US where Stine is volunteering as a co-organizer and participating in the Community Summit. As the first to embark on a WPCC fellowship, Stine will also help establish a framework for future Accessibility Fellowship cohorts.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;I am really excited for the future as this will allow me to commit real time to improving the project,&#8221; Stine said. &#8220;The support I received from the community shows me there are others who recognize the importance of accessibility.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Time itself is the biggest win here. The funding allows me to focus more of my day on WordPress and less on side work. The main projects include the Gutenberg post editor.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Stine recently conducted an <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H15BUb6_GU\">accessibility audit of Gutenberg</a>, which shows the current state of the block editor in WordPress 6.3.

Visiting the forums often means users have gotten stuck somehow and need to have a successful support experience in order to continue on their WordPress journeys. They are looking for help deciphering the meaning of error messages, migrating sites, debugging their sites after an update, and many other common struggles of self-hosting.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A <a href=\"https://meta.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/7161\">ticket</a> on Meta trac, which was opened three weeks ago, proposes that WordPress.org remove auto-closure from support forum threads and instead add a warning that the thread is old. Threads currently auto-close six months after last reply, unless manually closed sooner than that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Amber Hinds, plugin author and CEO of Equalize Digital, made a case for instances where it is necessary to respond to an old thread:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>As a plugin dev, we forgot to subscribe to a plugin&#8217;s forum and only saw support threads many months later. Currently, there is no way to provide assistance on these threads.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>If a user requests a feature that is not currently available and you release it many months later, it would be nice to update their support request and let them know.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Hinds referenced a conversation on Post Status&#8217; Slack where Matt Mullenweg recommended removing the closure for old threads completely and adding a warning in its place:</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\">\n<p>Let&#8217;s move away from auto-closing to just having a warning that you&#8217;re replying to an old thread</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Not all participants in the discussion are in favor of leaving support tickets open. Several contributors contended that this approach can lead to unproductive replies piling up or multiple people jumping in on threads with similar unrelated issues, making it difficult for developers to solve the original request. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Old topics mostly attract spam, me-too-pile&#8217;ons and random replies,<br />its very rare when an actual reply is needed to something that has no activity for&nbsp;<strong>six months</strong>,&#8221; WordPress support forums moderator Yui said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Current policy is to leave such topics closed, however, making an&nbsp;<strong>exclusion</strong>&nbsp;and manually reopen it at request can be made possible when the reasons for it are&nbsp;<strong>compelling</strong>&nbsp;(It can be discussed on Support team weekly chat, if needed).&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress accessibility contributor Joe Dolson is in favor of giving plugin authors the ability to determine when a thread gets closed, a modification that partially addresses the issues at play.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;It would help alleviate it to give plugin authors the ability to close a thread,&#8221; Dolson said. &#8220;Though when you have thousands of open support threads, that would still be a pretty significant potential burden.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;I think there should be a better way of handling closed support threads &#8211; it&#8217;s a problem that auto-closed threads literally *cannot* be re-opened because they&#8217;ll just auto-close again. But I&#8217;m dubious about just leaving them open.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;At the least, I think that removing the auto-closing *must* come with some ability for plugin authors to close threads; otherwise this would become totally unmanageable.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Changing thread closure policy could also impact the metric displayed on plugins, indicating how many issues have been marked as resolved in the last two months. If more people are allowed to jump in on threads with them open, the resolved threads metric may not be as meaningful.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<img width=\"806\" height=\"510\" src=\"https://149611589.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Screen-Shot-2023-08-16-at-4.06.11-PM.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-147891\" />\n\n\n\n<p>Hinds recommends a hybrid approach, keeping auto-close in place but allowing plugin contributors to reopen threads, restarting the clock for auto-closure.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;I discovered 12 support tickets yesterday on a plugin I had not realized we were not subscribed to, which I want to at least comment on to see if they still need help,&#8221; Hinds said. &#8220;I can&#8217;t do this.

Si vous êtes concerné·e, veuillez lire les notes de développement listées dans cet article consciencieusement afin de vous assurer que votre code fonctionnera avec WordPress&nbsp;6.2 lorsque cette version sortira le 28&nbsp;mars 2023.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"Themes\">Les polices Google Font sont maintenant incluses localement dans les thèmes natifs</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Suite aux incertitudes juridiques liées à l’utilisation des polices <em>Google Fonts</em> directement chargées depuis les serveurs de Google, les thèmes natifs qui embarquaient auparavant directement des polices provenant des serveurs de Google ne le feront plus à partir de WordPress 6.2.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cela concerne les thèmes suivants&nbsp;:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><em>Twenty Twelve</em> à partir de sa version 3.9</li>\n\n\n\n<li><em>Twenty Thirteen</em> à partir de sa version 3.8</li>\n\n\n\n<li><em>Twenty Fourteen</em> à partir de sa version 3.6</li>\n\n\n\n<li><em>Twenty Fifteen</em> à partir de sa version 3.4</li>\n\n\n\n<li><em>Twenty Sixteen</em> à partir de sa version 2.9</li>\n\n\n\n<li><em>Twenty Seventeen</em> à partir de sa version 3.2</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Les autres thèmes natifs n&rsquo;utilisent pas directement de polices Google et ne sont donc pas concernés par cette modification.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>À partir de maintenant, chaque thème concerné va servir une nouvelle feuille de styles depuis son propre répertoire, au sein du domaine de votre site. Si le thème embarque plusieurs polices différentes, votre thème les embarquera en les plaçant dans une seule feuille de styles pour de meilleures performances.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Voici par exemple la déclaration de feuille de styles de Twenty Thirteen&nbsp;:</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-syntaxhighlighter-code \"><pre class=\"brush: css; title: ; notranslate\">\n&lt;link\n	rel=&quot;stylesheet&quot;\n	id=&quot;twentythirteen-fonts-css&quot;\n	href=&quot;https://example.com/wp-content/themes/twentythirteen/fonts/source-sans-pro-plus-bitter.css?ver=20230328&quot;\n	media=&quot;all&quot;\n/&gt;\n</pre></div>\n\n\n<p>Comme vous pouvez le voir, les polices sont maintenant directement embarquées depuis les thèmes natifs, afin d’éviter toute dépendance tierce.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-background\" style=\"background-color:#fee7af\"><strong>Attention&nbsp;: si vous avez déjà modifié ou retiré l’appel <em>Google Fonts</em> via un thème enfant ou via une extension, il est recommandé de vérifier que ce changement n’affecte pas votre site.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Pour en savoir plus, consultez la note de développement suivante&nbsp;:</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-wp-embed is-provider-make-wordpress-core wp-block-embed-make-wordpress-core\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"Y9fix8byS8\"><a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2023/03/06/google-fonts-are-included-locally-in-bundled-themes/\">Google Fonts are included locally in bundled themes</a></blockquote><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" title=\"&#8220;Google Fonts are included locally in bundled themes&#8221; &#8212; Make WordPress Core\" src=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2023/03/06/google-fonts-are-included-locally-in-bundled-themes/embed/#?secret=LQGDbnYuSO#?secret=Y9fix8byS8\" data-secret=\"Y9fix8byS8\" width=\"600\" height=\"338\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"blockeditor\">L’éditeur de blocs</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress 6.2 comprend 10 versions du projet Gutenberg –&nbsp;<a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2022/09/30/whats-new-in-gutenberg-14-2-28-september/\">14.2</a>, <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2022/10/13/whats-new-in-gutenberg-14-3-12-october/\">14.3</a>, <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2022/10/27/whats-new-in-gutenberg-14-4-26-october/\">14.4</a>, <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2022/11/09/whats-new-in-gutenberg-14-5-9-november/\">14.5</a>, <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2022/11/23/whats-new-in-gutenberg-14-6-23-november/\">14.6</a>, <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2022/12/09/whats-new-in-gutenberg-14-7-7-december/\">14.7</a>, <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2022/12/22/whats-new-in-gutenberg-14-8-21-december/\">14.8</a>, <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2023/01/04/whats-new-in-gutenberg-14-9-4-january/\">14.9</a>, <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2023/01/20/whats-new-in-gutenberg-15-0-18-january/\">15.0</a> et <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2023/02/10/whats-new-in-gutenberg-15-1-8-february/\">15.1</a>.

Voici la note de développement dédiée aux modifications ayant eu lieu sur ce composant&nbsp;:</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-wp-embed is-provider-make-wordpress-core wp-block-embed-make-wordpress-core\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"PmeBBCqf9M\"><a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2023/03/03/i18n-improvements-in-6-2/\">I18N Improvements in 6.2</a></blockquote><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" title=\"&#8220;I18N Improvements in 6.2&#8221; &#8212; Make WordPress Core\" src=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2023/03/03/i18n-improvements-in-6-2/embed/#?secret=oN9FSuxaex#?secret=PmeBBCqf9M\" data-secret=\"PmeBBCqf9M\" width=\"600\" height=\"338\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">API de gestion des fichiers système</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Si vous utilisiez la fonction <code>copy_dir()</code> pour déplacer des répertoires, vous serez probablement heureux de découvrir la nouvelle fonction <code>move_dir()</code>, qui arrive avec WordPress 6.2.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-wp-embed is-provider-make-wordpress-core wp-block-embed-make-wordpress-core\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"iD9AZGTuz0\"><a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2023/03/07/introducing-move_dir-in-wordpress-6-2/\">Introducing move_dir() in WordPress 6.2</a></blockquote><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" title=\"&#8220;Introducing move_dir() in WordPress 6.2&#8221; &#8212; Make WordPress Core\" src=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2023/03/07/introducing-move_dir-in-wordpress-6-2/embed/#?secret=2lu0bdfgVX#?secret=iD9AZGTuz0\" data-secret=\"iD9AZGTuz0\" width=\"600\" height=\"338\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Notons également l&rsquo;apparition de la fonction <code>wp_opcache_invalidate()</code>&nbsp;qui sert à vider OPcache pour des fichiers PHP individuels après les avoir surchargés. La fonction &nbsp;<code>wp_opcache_invalidate_directory()</code>&nbsp;a été ajoutée dans le cadre du ticket <a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/57375\">#57375</a> afin de vider le cache OPcache de façon récursive pour les fichiers PHP après les avoir surchargés. Cette fonction accepte un paramètre unique <code>$dir</code>, pointant vers le répertoire contenant les fichiers PHP pour lesquels OPcache doit être vidé.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Dans le ticket <a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/57375\">#57375</a>, la méthode&nbsp;<code>WP_Filesystem_Direct::move()</code>&nbsp;a reçu la possibilité de gérer des répertoires afin de la rendre cohérente par rapport aux méthodes <code>::move()</code> présentes dans <code>WP_Filesystem_FTPext</code>,&nbsp;<code>WP_Filesystem_ftpsockets</code>&nbsp;et&nbsp;<code>WP_Filesystem_SSH2</code>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Base de données</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>La possibilité de nettoyer les noms de tables et de champs a été ajoutée dans la méthode <code>wpdb::prepare()</code>.

Cela est clairement visualisable dans les tests que nous avons conduits avec des mesures de <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1LroIJoYz-O9CpfJzaiKYYMWJ7GbE5RZoW1rf1R4FqyA/edit#gid=996638482\">signaux web essentiels (<em>Web Vitals</em> en anglais)</a> et de <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1LroIJoYz-O9CpfJzaiKYYMWJ7GbE5RZoW1rf1R4FqyA/edit#gid=0\">chargement côté serveur (<em>Server Timing</em> en anglais)</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Les performances des thèmes basés sur des blocs ont également été améliorées, avec un <a href=\"https://web.dev/ttfb/\">TTFB (en anglais <em>Time to First Byte</em>, ou temps de chargement du premier octet</a>) qui est environ 20&nbsp;% plus rapide, et aussi 14&nbsp;% d&rsquo;amélioration sur le <a href=\"https://web.dev/lcp/\">LCP (<em>Largest Contenful Paint</em>, représentant le temps avant que la page complète soit lisible)</a>. Sur des pages où vous utilisez de grandes bannières d’images, vous devriez même observer une amélioration du critère LCP d&rsquo;environ 19&nbsp;%.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Autres améliorations de performances&nbsp;:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Le nouveau filtre <code>pre_wp_load_alloptions</code> permet de court-circuiter le chargement des options auto-chargées de WordPress avec des conditions personnalisées. Voir le <a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/56045\">ticket #56045</a> pour plus d&rsquo;informations.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Les résultats de la fonction <code>get_adjacent_post()</code> sont maintenant mis en cache. Voir le <a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/41131\">ticket #41131</a>.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Les clés de mise en cache de <code>WP_Term_Query</code> sont dorénavant basées sur du SQL sans variables, afin de pouvoir être mises en cache. Voir le <a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/57298\">ticket #57298</a>.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><code>WP_Query</code> ne parcourt désormais plus les publications deux fois avant de les retourner. Ça peut paraître une évidence, mais le <a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/57373\">ticket #57373</a> a nécessité beaucoup de travail sur ce point.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Le chargement différé des métadonnées des termes de taxonomies est à présent plus rapide, grâce à l’utilisation de la fonction <code>wp_cache_get_multiple()</code>. Voir le <a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/57150\">ticket #57150</a>.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Les résultats de <code>wp_get_global_settings()</code> sont maintenant placés en cache au sein d’une seule et unique requête, ce qui améliore de 8&nbsp;% les temps de réponse du cœur WordPress. Pour en savoir plus, voir le <a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/57502\">ticket #57502</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Thèmes</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Les développeuses et développeurs de thèmes WordPress pourront apprécier l&rsquo;arrivée de nouvelles fonctionnalités, et devront aussi prendre en compte la suppression de certains fonctionnalités obsolètes&nbsp;:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>La fonctionnalité «&nbsp;Variations de styles&nbsp;» a été ajoutée dans la liste des filtres sur les thèmes sur WordPress.org. Voir le <a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/56869\">ticket #56869</a>.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Le fichier <code>theme.json</code> prend maintenant en charge davantage de pseudo-classes CSS liées aux liens hypertextes, comme <code>:link</code>&nbsp;ou&nbsp;<code>:any-link</code>. Voir le <a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/57053\">ticket #57053</a>.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Les thèmes possédant un nom composé de chiffres sont désormais pris en charge par le CMS via un changement dans&nbsp;<code>WP_Theme::__construct()</code>. Voir le <a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/54645\">ticket #54645</a>.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Amélioration des performances des fonctions <code>_add_block_template_part_area_info</code> et <code>_add_block_template_info</code> en diminuant les appels à la fonction  <code>get_option</code>. Voir le <a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/57077\">ticket #57077</a>.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Une mise en cache a été ajoutée sur <code>WP_Theme::is_block_theme()</code>. Voir le <a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/57114\">ticket #57114</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Bibliothèques externes</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>La bibliothèque jQuery a été mise à jour, elle est passée de la version 3.6.3 à 3.6.4.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>En outre, la bibliothèque <code>Requests</code> a aussi été mise à jour. Une note de développement détaille d&rsquo;ailleurs les changements apportés&nbsp;:</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-wp-embed is-provider-make-wordpress-core wp-block-embed-make-wordpress-core\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"bkYeQfRrWr\"><a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2023/03/08/requests-library-upgraded-to-2-0-5-in-wordpress-6-2/\">Requests library upgraded to 2.0.5 in WordPress 6.2</a></blockquote><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" title=\"&#8220;Requests library upgraded to 2.0.5 in WordPress 6.2&#8221; &#8212; Make WordPress Core\" src=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2023/03/08/requests-library-upgraded-to-2-0-5-in-wordpress-6-2/embed/#?secret=KYn2V4QANu#?secret=bkYeQfRrWr\" data-secret=\"bkYeQfRrWr\" width=\"600\" height=\"338\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Autres mises à jour</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Plusieurs crochets d’action et filtres ont été mis à jour, vous les trouverez dans la note de développement suivante&nbsp;:</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-wp-embed is-provider-make-wordpress-core wp-block-embed-make-wordpress-core\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"NbmRoqD5xC\"><a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2023/03/07/miscellaneous-developer-changes-in-wordpress-6-2/\">Miscellaneous developer changes in WordPress 6.2</a></blockquote><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" title=\"&#8220;Miscellaneous developer changes in WordPress 6.2&#8221; &#8212; Make WordPress Core\" src=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2023/03/07/miscellaneous-developer-changes-in-wordpress-6-2/embed/#?secret=mwuiUZgXSy#?secret=NbmRoqD5xC\" data-secret=\"NbmRoqD5xC\" width=\"600\" height=\"338\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"wait\">Mais ce n’est pas tout&nbsp;!</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Voici d’autres composants qui ont reçu des mises à jour notables.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Processus de chargement de WP</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Ajout d&rsquo;une vérification que les fonctions&nbsp;<code>mysqli_connect()</code>&nbsp;ou&nbsp;<code>mysql_connect()</code>&nbsp;sont bien disponibles. Cela résout une erreur fatale potentiellement provoquée par l&rsquo;absence de l’extension PHP <code>mysqli</code> sur le serveur, et affiche un message d&rsquo;erreur clair le cas échéant. Voir le ticket <a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/51988\">#51988</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Commentaires</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Ajout de la possibilité de passer le paramètre&nbsp;<code>$comment_ID</code>&nbsp;aux fonctions <code>get_comment_time()</code> et <code>comment_time()</code>. Cela apporte une meilleure cohérence vis-à-vis des fonctions similaires <code>get_comment_date()</code> et <code>comment_date()</code>. Voir le <a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/52322\">ticket #52322</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Mots de passe d’applications</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Les URL en <code>HTTP</code> sont désormais autorisées pour la création de mots de passe d’applications dans le cadre d’un environnement local. Voir le <a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/52617\">ticket #52617</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Bibliothèques externes</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Les bibliothèques suivantes ont été mises à jour&nbsp;:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>jQuery (voir le <a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/57324\">ticket #57324</a>)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>jQuery Migrate (voir le <a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/56743\">ticket #56743</a>)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>PHPMailer (voir le <a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/57281\">ticket #57281</a>)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>element-closest (voir le <a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/52851\">ticket#52851</a>)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>regenerator runtime (voir le <a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/57646\">ticket #57646</a>)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>polyfill-library (voir le <a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/57646\">ticket #57646</a>)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Requests 2.0 (voir le <a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/54504\">ticket #54504</a>). Pour en savoir plus sur cette mise à jour,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/Requests/blob/stable/docs/upgrading.md\">voir la documentation de la bibliothèque Requests 2.0</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Formattage</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Optimisation de la fonction de bas niveau&nbsp;<code>wp_kses_bad_protocol()</code>&nbsp;afin d&rsquo;améliorer les performances de la fonction d&rsquo;échappement&nbsp;<code>esc_url()</code>. Voir le <a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/52617\">ticket #22951</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Modernisation du code</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Un énorme travail a été fait pour améliorer encore la conformité de la structure du code de WordPress vis-à-vis des versions de PHP supérieures à 8.0. Voir le <a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/56788\">ticket #56788</a>.  </p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">E-mails</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>L&rsquo;ajout de pièce jointes avec noms de fichiers personnalisés dans la fonction <code>wp_mail()</code> est maintenant possible en passant un tableau associatif <code>$attachments</code>, où les chaînes utilisées en tant que clés seront employées pour déterminer les noms de fichiers. Voir le <a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/28407\">ticket #28407</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Médias</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Il est maintenant possible de fournir explicitement une valeur booléenne <code>false</code> au paramètre&nbsp;<code>$attr</code>&nbsp;de la fonction <code>wp_get_attachment_image()</code> afin de s&rsquo;assurer que l&rsquo;attribut <code>decoding</code> n&rsquo;est pas ajouté au média. Voir le <a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/57086\">ticket #57086</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>La logique permettant de déterminer les images participant au <a href=\"https://web.dev/lcp/\">LCP (<em>Largest Contenful Paint</em>, représentant le temps avant que la page complète soit lisible)</a> au sein des thèmes basés sur des blocs a été grandement améliorée, afin de s&rsquo;assurer que ces images ne soient pas chargées en différé. Cela permet d&rsquo;améliorer la conformité LCP des thèmes basés sur des blocs. Cette modification tire par ailleurs profit du principe des éléments de modèles de l&rsquo;éditeur de site pour éviter de charger en différé les médias situés dans l&rsquo;entête du site. Un <a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/56930#comment:53\">test conduit sur une page créée via un thème basé sur des blocs</a> a permis de souligner une amélioration de <strong>19&nbsp;% du critère LCP sur WordPress 6.2</strong>. Voir les tickets <a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/56930\">#56930</a> et <a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/57490\">#57490</a> pour plus de détails.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">API REST</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Ajout de la prise en charge de caractères non latins dans la Regex utilisée pour le point de terminaison <code>template</code>. Ces caractères sont encodés afin de pouvoir être utilisés dans une URL (exemple&nbsp;:&nbsp;<code>%cf%84%ce%b5%cf%83%cf%84</code>). Voir le <a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/57329\">ticket #57329</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Gestion des comptes</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Ajout du nouveau crochet d&rsquo;action&nbsp;<code>wp_set_password</code>, déclenché après la création d&rsquo;un mot de passe pour un compte déterminé. Cela aidera les auteur·ices d&rsquo;extensions à intercepter toutes les utilisations de <code>wp_set_password()</code>, qu&rsquo;elles proviennent du cœur de WordPress ou d&rsquo;autres extensions.

En savoir plus sur les&nbsp;<a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2022/10/11/wordpress-6-1-accessibility-improvements/\">améliorations d’accessibilité apportées par WP 6.1</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Autres changements importants</h2>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Éléments de modèles de blocs dans les thèmes classiques</h3>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2022/10/04/block-based-template-parts-in-traditional-themes/\"></a>Les éléments de modèles de blocs peuvent désormais être <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2022/10/04/block-based-template-parts-in-traditional-themes/\">définis dans les thèmes classiques (en anglais)</a>&nbsp;en ajoutant les fichiers HTML appropriés au répertoire&nbsp;<code>parts</code>&nbsp;à la racine du thème.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Évolution des blocs de boucle de requête</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Les&nbsp;<a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2022/10/10/extending-the-query-loop-block/\">nouveaux filtres</a>&nbsp;permettent aux variantes du bloc de requête de prendre en charge des requêtes personnalisées afin de créer des variantes plus spécifiques et des options avancées de filtrage des types de publication hiérarchiques.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Des filtres pour tous vos styles</h3>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2022/10/10/filters-for-theme-json-data/\"><a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2022/10/10/filters-for-theme-json-data/\">Exploitez les filtres</a> dans la barre latérale « Styles » pour contrôler les réglages sur quatre niveaux de votre site, du moins spécifique au plus spécifique : principal, thème, compte, bloc.</a></p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Préréglages d’espacement pour une conception plus rapide et cohérente</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Gagnez du temps et évitez de coder en dur des déclarations dans un thème grâce aux&nbsp;<a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2022/10/07/introduction-of-presets-across-padding-margin-and-block-gap/\">valeurs de marge internes et externes prédéfinies pour de multiples blocs</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Modification limitée au contenu sur les blocs conteneurs</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Grâce au&nbsp;<a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2022/10/11/content-locking-features-and-updates/\">réglage de modification limitée au contenu</a>, les mises en page peuvent être verrouillées au sein des blocs conteneurs. Dans un bloc de contenu seul, ses blocs enfants sont invisibles dans la vue en liste et ne sont pas modifiables. Vous contrôlez donc la mise en page tandis que vos rédactrices et rédacteurs peuvent se concentrer sur le contenu.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Combinez-la avec les options de verrouillage des blocs pour un contrôle encore plus poussé de vos blocs.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">De meilleures performances</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress 6.1 résout 25 tickets dédiés à l’amélioration des performances. De&nbsp;<a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2022/10/10/performance-improvements-to-the-rest-api/\">l’API REST</a>&nbsp;au&nbsp;<a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2022/10/10/multisite-improvements-in-wordpress-6-1/\">multisite</a>, en passant par&nbsp;<a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2022/10/07/improvements-to-wp_query-performance-in-6-1/\"><code>WP_Query</code></a>&nbsp;<a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2022/10/07/improved-php-performance-for-core-blocks-registration/\">l’enregistrement des blocs du cœur WordPress</a>&nbsp;et par de&nbsp;<a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2022/10/06/new-cache-site-health-checks-in-wordpress-6-1/\">nouvelles vérifications sur l’outil Santé du site</a>, ou par l’ajout des attributs&nbsp;<code>async</code>&nbsp;aux images, il y a des améliorations bénéfiques pour tous les types de sites. Un récapitulatif complet est disponible dans le&nbsp;<a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2022/10/11/performance-field-guide-for-wordpress-6-1/\">guide dédié aux performance de WP&nbsp;6.1</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Guide des changements techniques de WordPress 6.1</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress 6.1 comprend encore bien plus de nouvelles fonctionnalités et d’améliorations.

Les changements les plus significatifs portent sur les requêtes&nbsp;<code>WP_Query</code>&nbsp;et sur l’API REST, deux points qui impactent grandement les temps de chargement de votre site. L’un des changements les plus attendus concernait notamment la mise en cache des requêtes&nbsp;<code>WP_Query</code>, et c’est maintenant une réalité avec WP&nbsp;6.1.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>De nouveaux points de contrôle ont aussi été ajoutés dans l’écran de&nbsp;<em>Santé du site</em>, qui vous indiquera maintenant si la mise en cache des pages et le cache persistant fonctionnent correctement sur votre site.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Plusieurs améliorations conséquentes sur l’API de mise en cache de WordPress ont également été mises en œuvre, et l’ordre d’exécution général des crochets d’action a été optimisé pour retarder le moins possible l’affichage des pages.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>L’enregistrement de blocs personnalisés pour l’éditeur à l’aide de fichiers&nbsp;<code>block.json</code>&nbsp;a aussi été rendu bien plus performant.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Et ce n’est qu’une petite partie des améliorations de performances de WP 6.1. Pour en découvrir plus, voici un guide spécifique sur les performances dans cette nouvelle version de WP&nbsp;:</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-wp-embed is-provider-make-wordpress-core wp-block-embed-make-wordpress-core\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"qnD9kaPwLM\"><a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2022/10/11/performance-field-guide-for-wordpress-6-1/\">Performance Field Guide for WordPress 6.1</a></blockquote><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" title=\"&#8220;Performance Field Guide for WordPress 6.1&#8221; &#8212; Make WordPress Core\" src=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2022/10/11/performance-field-guide-for-wordpress-6-1/embed/#?secret=S9AxfZHdKy#?secret=qnD9kaPwLM\" data-secret=\"qnD9kaPwLM\" width=\"600\" height=\"338\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Accessibilité</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Il s’agit du second focus principal de WordPress 6.1, avec&nbsp;<a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/query?status=closed&amp;focuses=~accessibility&amp;milestone=6.1&amp;group=component&amp;col=id&amp;col=summary&amp;col=focuses&amp;col=version&amp;col=keywords&amp;order=priority\">28 tickets sur Trac</a>, concernant 13 des principaux composants du CMS. De nombreuses améliorations ont été faites sur l’éditeur de blocs et sur la fonctionnalité d’édition complète du site, quelques éléments encore non conformes sur les différents écrans d’administration ont été corrigés, et beaucoup d’autres améliorations ont été faites pour faciliter l’utilisation de WordPress par toutes et tous.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Une attention particulière a également été portée sur la gestion des champs requis sur les différents formulaires de l’interface d’administration&nbsp;: pour faciliter leur maintenance, une petite API a été créée afin de gérer de façon centralisée leur affichage. Celle-ci est publique et peut donc être utilisée par les personnes réalisant des développements sur mesure.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Notons également qu’avec WordPress 6.1, les deux thèmes natifs&nbsp;<a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/54467\">Twenty Twenty-Three</a>&nbsp;(nous reparlerons de celui-là dans un article dédié&nbsp;!) et&nbsp;<a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/wordpress-develop/pull/2324/files\">Twenty Twenty-Two</a>&nbsp;font leur entrée parmi les premiers&nbsp;<em>Block Themes</em>&nbsp;(ces thèmes entièrement modifiables avec l’éditeur de blocs) ayant obtenu le libellé&nbsp;<code>accessibility-ready</code>&nbsp;sur le répertoire de thèmes WordPress.org.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Pour en savoir plus sur toutes ces améliorations concernant l’accessibilité de WordPress, consultez le guide spécifique proposé par l’équipe&nbsp;<em>Accessibility</em>&nbsp;:</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-wp-embed is-provider-make-wordpress-core wp-block-embed-make-wordpress-core\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"gOxSBctZIG\"><a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2022/10/11/wordpress-6-1-accessibility-improvements/\">WordPress 6.1 Accessibility Improvements</a></blockquote><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" title=\"&#8220;WordPress 6.1 Accessibility Improvements&#8221; &#8212; Make WordPress Core\" src=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2022/10/11/wordpress-6-1-accessibility-improvements/embed/#?secret=Rp2Ep8E3XI#?secret=gOxSBctZIG\" data-secret=\"gOxSBctZIG\" width=\"600\" height=\"338\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">L’éditeur de blocs</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>C’est évidemment encore et toujours un des axes concentrant le plus d’évolutions d’une version à une autre&nbsp;<img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f60a.png\" alt=\"😊\" class=\"wp-smiley\" style=\"height: 1em; max-height: 1em;\" /></p>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress 6.1 embarque les versions&nbsp;<a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2022/04/28/whats-new-in-gutenberg-13-1-27-april/\">13.1</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2022/05/12/whats-new-in-gutenberg-13-2-may-11/\">13.2</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2022/05/26/whats-new-in-gutenberg-13-3-0-may-25/\">13.3</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2022/06/10/whats-new-in-gutenberg-13-4-8-june/\">13.4</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2022/06/22/whats-new-in-gutenberg-13-5-22-june/\">13.5</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2022/07/07/whats-new-in-gutenberg-13-6-6-july/\">13.6</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2022/07/20/whats-new-in-gutenberg-13-7-20-july/\">13.7</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2022/08/04/whats-new-in-gutenberg-13-8-3-august/\">13.8</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2022/08/17/whats-new-in-gutenberg-13-9-17-august/\">13.9</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2022/09/01/whats-new-in-gutenberg-14-0-31-august/\">14.0</a>, et&nbsp;<a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2022/09/16/whats-new-in-gutenberg-14-1-15-september/\">14.1</a>&nbsp;du projet Gutenberg.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Parmi les nombreux changements de ces 10 versions de l’extension Gutenberg, un gros effort a été fait pour rendre les blocs et autres fonctionnalités de l’éditeur de plus en plus disponibles pour les thèmes «&nbsp;classiques&nbsp;», c’est à dire les thèmes qui ne prennent pas encore en charge l’édition complète du site à l’aide de blocs, une fonctionnalité introduite dans le CMS en 2022 avec WordPress&nbsp;5.9.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>L’objectif est de faciliter le travail des développeuses et des développeurs pour effectuer une transition de leurs thèmes «&nbsp;classiques&nbsp;» vers le principe du thème basé sur des blocs, que celui-ci soit entièrement ou partiellement modifiable dans l’éditeur. Nous espérons que cela poussera encore plus les personnes développant des thèmes WordPress à exploiter au maximum les fonctionnalités de l’éditeur.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Par ailleurs, de nombreuses fonctionnalités utiles au quotidien ont été ajoutées dans cette version&nbsp;: filtrage des données du&nbsp;<code>theme.json</code>, nouveau système de gestion des préférences dans l’éditeur, possibilité de modifier et étendre le bloc «&nbsp;Boucle de requête&nbsp;», et bien plus encore.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Vous trouverez ci-dessous les différentes notes de développement concernant l’éditeur de WordPress&nbsp;:</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-wp-embed is-provider-make-wordpress-core wp-block-embed-make-wordpress-core\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"dBrmxcR9rG\"><a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2022/10/12/block-api-changes-in-wordpress-6-1/\">Block API changes in WordPress 6.1</a></blockquote><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" title=\"&#8220;Block API changes in WordPress 6.1&#8221;

Cela évitera que votre site propose une mise à jour et écrase votre thème dans le cas où un thème du répertoire officiel porterait le même identifiant (slug) que le vôtre&nbsp;!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ensuite nous avons plusieurs notes de développement concernant les interactions entre les thèmes et l’éditeur de site. Et notamment la possibilité de créer des éléments de modèles basés sur des blocs au sein d’un thème classique, c’est à dire d’un thème ne proposant au départ pas de compatibilité avec l’édition complète de site (<em>full site editing</em>).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Enfin, on notera l&rsquo;arrivée de la gestion fluide des polices typographiques, qui permettent de définir la taille de typo de façon à ce qu&rsquo;elle s&rsquo;adapte dynamiquement à la largeur de l&rsquo;écran.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-wp-embed is-provider-make-wordpress-core wp-block-embed-make-wordpress-core\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"kTK0wJfy87\"><a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2022/10/06/introducing-update-uri-theme-header-in-wordpress-6-1/\">Introducing “Update URI” theme header in WordPress 6.1</a></blockquote><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" title=\"&#8220;Introducing “Update URI” theme header in WordPress 6.1&#8221;

Cette nouvelle brique vise à améliorer un aspect encore trop peu considéré des blocs : leur comportement côté front, c’est-à-dire la façon dont ils se manifestent visuellement pour l’utilisateur final.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>L&rsquo;interactivité, dans ce contexte, désigne la capacité d&rsquo;un bloc à répondre immédiatement à une action utilisateur. Pensez à un bloc accordéon qui s&rsquo;ouvre, un sous-menu qui s’affiche ou encore à une modification des quantités d&rsquo;un panier sur un site e-commerce.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ces interactions étaient jusqu&rsquo;alors laissées à l&rsquo;appréciation de chaque développeur, entrainant plusieurs challenges techniques sur lesquelles nous reviendrons plus tard dans cet article. Mais avant cela, commençons par rappeler l’intérêt pour le CMS open source WordPress de s&rsquo;orienter vers la création de nouvelles API.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Le rôle essentiel des API dans WordPress</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress propose une vaste gamme d&rsquo;<strong><a href=\"https://developer.wordpress.org/apis/\">Interfaces de Programmation Applicative</a></strong>, plus connues sous l&rsquo;acronyme anglais API.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Leur intérêt ? Standardiser de nombreux aspects du code que les développeurs d’extensions et de thèmes WordPress pourraient avoir à écrire. Au lieu de repartir de zéro à chaque fois, ils bénéficient d&rsquo;une palette de ressources prédéfinies, comme des fonctions ou des classes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Voici les avantages clés :</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Simplicité et Clarté</strong> : Les codes requis sont non seulement standardisés, mais aussi bien documentés, les rendant accessibles à tous les développeurs utilisant WordPress.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Sécurité et Performance</strong> : Ces deux aspects sont gérés par défaut par les API, qui bénéficient en plus du regard expert de la communauté qui participe au développement du cœur de WordPress.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Flexibilité</strong> : Les API peuvent être ajustées et enrichies au fil du temps, offrant toujours plus de possibilités, de correctifs et d&rsquo;améliorations, sans contraindre les développeurs à revoir constamment leur code.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Les API WordPress ne sont pas seulement des outils pour faciliter la vie des développeurs. Elles incarnent la vision de WordPress pour un développement web plus efficace, sécurisé et évolutif.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Renforcer l’interactivité</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>L&rsquo;éditeur de blocs WordPress offre déjà une large gamme d&rsquo;outils permettant une édition riche des contenus en backoffice. Mais jusqu&rsquo;à récemment, les développeurs désireux de proposer des rendus complexes et/ou interactif sur la partie front devaient concevoir leur propre solution, souvent sans lignes directrices claires ni bonnes pratiques établies. Cette hétérogénéité de solutions pouvait altérer la performance, l&rsquo;accessibilité et la sécurité des pages.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>L&rsquo;introduction de l&rsquo;éditeur de site, ou « Full Site Editing » (FSE), a mis ce problème en lumière, avec sa construction à partir de blocs. En réponse à cela, un groupe de développeurs a entrepris de concevoir une solution&nbsp;: leur réflexion a donné lieu à <strong><a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2023/03/30/proposal-the-interactivity-api-a-better-developer-experience-in-building-interactive-blocks/\">un article détaillé</a></strong>, présentant cette nouvelle API,  ainsi qu&rsquo;un <strong><a href=\"https://wpmovies.dev/\">site de démonstration</a></strong>. Son déploiement comporte des défis, puisqu’elle doit être fonctionnelle côté serveur lors du rendu de la page et côté navigateur où l’utilisateur va interagir avec les blocs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Pour cette API, les développeurs ont établi des critères essentiels, tels que :</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Une intégration fluide avec la logique actuelle des blocs, accessible côté serveur en PHP,</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Une compatibilité avec le cœur de WordPress et les extensions existantes, y compris tous les crochets pour manipuler le rendu HTML,</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Une mise en œuvre optionnelle pour la maintenance ou la création de blocs, avec une adoption progressive selon les besoins,</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Une influence minimale sur la performance des pages web.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>D&rsquo;autres conditions ciblent spécifiquement les développeurs d&rsquo;extensions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cette nouvelle API présente le potentiel de transformer la dynamique des blocs face aux interactions des utilisateurs. Elle permet aux développeurs de se focaliser sur leurs objectifs métiers, tout en simplifiant la mise en place des fondements techniques nécessaires à ces ambitions.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Pour les utilisateurs finaux</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Bien que conçue initialement pour optimiser le quotidien des développeurs, cette nouvelle API présente des bénéfices tangibles pour tous, avec en tête de liste une amélioration significative des performances et une consolidation de la sécurité.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Comme mentionné précédemment, les avantages offerts par les APIs sont vastes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Concernant l&rsquo;API d&rsquo;interactivité, ses principaux atouts pour les utilisateurs finaux se distinguent par :</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Une navigation plus rapide et fluide:</strong> Avec moins de ressources à charger et une optimisation maximale, les utilisateurs bénéficient d&rsquo;un temps de chargement réduit et d&rsquo;une meilleure réactivité, garantissant une expérience optimisée.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Qualité du code :</strong> Le socle programmatique est revu et approuvé par une communauté de développeurs soucieuse de sa performance, sa sécurité et sa capacité d&rsquo;évolution. Un code de qualité se traduit par moins de bugs, de défaillances et d&rsquo;interruptions &#8211; tout cela contribuant à une navigation plus fluide et plus sécurisée.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Interopérabilité :</strong> Cette nouveauté assure une harmonie entre différents éléments d&rsquo;une page, permettant des d&rsquo;interactions plus intelligentes et intuitives. Que ce soit un widget météo qui s&rsquo;adapte en fonction de votre localisation ou une intégration e-commerce qui suggère des produits en fonction de votre navigation, cette interopérabilité enrichit considérablement l&rsquo;expérience utilisateur.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Pour les développeurs</h2>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Cette nouvelle API n’est pas encore stabilisée, les exemples de codes sont donnés à titre d’exemple et vont très probablement être modifiés dans le futur.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>L’un des points forts de cette nouvelle API en termes de développement est d’être réactive. On y retrouve les éléments qui font la force de la philosophie de React: des “interfaces“ dérivées d’un état précis. Le développeur décrit la façon dont l’interface doit s’afficher et comment son état doit être modifié et la librairie sous-jacente s’occupe de détecter les événements, mettre à jour l’état et muter l’interface en conséquence. C’est là toute la philosophie de l’éditeur de blocs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>À l’inverse, pour ajouter de l’interactivité sur des éléments d’un site, il était souvent question de passer par jQuery (ou du JavaScript natif). Avec cette approche, le développeur est chargé de la gestion du rendu de l’interface, de la détection des événements, de la mise à jour de l&rsquo;état et de la modification de l&rsquo;interface. Plus les éléments à mettre à jour sont nombreux, plus cette méthode révèle ses faiblesses.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Un autre impératif crucial pour cette API était sa compatibilité avec le rendu côté serveur. Le HTML produit par le serveur doit constituer le fondement du côté client, sur lequel une dimension interactive est superposée. Ce HTML ne doit pas être intégralement remplacé. D&rsquo;un point de vue performance et SEO, cela garantit l&rsquo;affichage instantané d&rsquo;un contenu tangible, évitant un effet « page vierge » pendant le téléchargement et l&rsquo;exécution du JavaScript nécessaire au rendu. Cela assure également que toute modification apportée au HTML côté serveur est conservée, comme l&rsquo;ajout éventuel de classes CSS.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Pour la composante « réactive », l&rsquo;équipe a opté pour la bibliothèque <strong><a href=\"https://preactjs.com/\">Preact</a></strong>, qui, tout en étant plus compacte, emprunte largement aux concepts de <strong><a href=\"https://react.dev/\">React</a></strong>. C&rsquo;est cette couche qui orchestre la mise à jour des interfaces en fonction des interactions des utilisateurs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>La véritable innovation réside dans la méthode d&rsquo;intégration des éléments interactifs, réalisée par le biais de directives HTML. Ce principe s&rsquo;inspire de ce qui est fait par la librairie <a href=\"https://alpinejs.dev/\">AlpineJs</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Via ce système, on peut facilement enrichir un code HTML pour lui permettre de déclencher des actions ou de réagir à des changements (des « effets »).</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-wab-pastacode\">\n	<div class=\"code-embed-wrapper\"> <pre class=\"language-markup code-embed-pre line-numbers\" data-start=\"1\" data-line-offset=\"0\"><code class=\"language-markup code-embed-code\">&lt;div<br //>  data-wp-context=&#039;{ &quot;isOpen&quot;: false }&#039;<br //>  data-wp-effect=&quot;effects.logIsOpen&quot;<br //>&gt;<br //>  &lt;button<br //>    data-wp-on--click=&quot;actions.toggle&quot;<br //>    data-wp-bind--aria-expanded=&quot;context.isOpen&quot;<br //>    aria-controls=&quot;p-1&quot;<br //>  &gt;<br //>    Toggle<br //>  &lt;/button&gt;<br //> <br //>  &lt;p id=&quot;p-1&quot; data-wp-show=&quot;context.isOpen&quot;&gt;<br //>    This element is now visible!<br //>  &lt;/p&gt;<br //>&lt;/div&gt;</code></pre> <div class=\"code-embed-infos\"> </div> </div></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Ces directives vont permettre de lier les éléments HTML avec la partie réactive en JavaScript</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-wab-pastacode\">\n	<div class=\"code-embed-wrapper\"> <pre class=\"language-javascript code-embed-pre line-numbers\" data-start=\"1\" data-line-offset=\"0\"><code class=\"language-javascript code-embed-code\">import { store } from &quot;@wordpress/interactivity&quot;;<br //> <br //>store({<br //>  actions: {<br //>    toggle: ({ context }) =&gt; {<br //>      context.isOpen = !context.isOpen;<br //>    },<br //>  },<br //>  effects: {<br //>    logIsOpen: ({ context }) =&gt; {<br //>      // Log the value of `isOpen` each time it changes.<br //>      console.log(`Is open: ${context.isOpen}`);<br //>    },<br //>  },<br //>});</code></pre> <div class=\"code-embed-infos\"> </div> </div></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Dans l&rsquo;exemple ci-dessus (issu de l&rsquo;article de présentation de l&rsquo;API interactivé publié sur le bloc Make Core), on a un « bloc » fictif qui fonctionne comme un accordéon.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Pour résumer le fonctionnement, lorsque l&rsquo;utilisateur clique sur l&rsquo;élément bouton, celui-ci vient changer la valeur de l&rsquo;état <code>isOpen</code>. Au moment où cette valeur change, cela va avoir pour effet (d&rsquo;où le nom « effect » utilisé en anglais) d&rsquo;afficher ou de masquer l&rsquo;élément paragraphe.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tout ce fonctionnement est porté par les directives visibles dans le HTML comme <code>data-wp-on--click</code>, <code>data-wp-show</code> et qui font le pont avec le code JavaScript.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>L&rsquo;article sur le Core est très bien fait et présente plus complète du mécanisme et des directives en faisant le parallèle avec React.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Conclusion</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Ainsi, l&rsquo;éditeur Gutenberg continue d’évoluer et de s’améliorer. Cette nouvelle API est une proposition très intéressante pour faciliter le développement d’expériences interactives via les blocs. Les développeurs qui ont contribué à sa création ont poussé la réflexion pour proposer une solution s&rsquo;intégrant parfaitement dans l&rsquo;écosystème WordPress existant, en restant le plus léger possible. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Des développeurs travaillant sur le projet Gutenberg ou WooCommerce ont déjà commencé à faire évoluer leurs blocs pour profiter des nouvelles possibilités qu’offre cette API. Il a y fort à parier qu’elle va continuer d’évoluer &#8211; mais il est intéressant de voir qu’elle est déjà exploitée.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Si vous souhaitez suivre les développements, un <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/discussions/52906\">changelog</a> est disponible pour suivre les évolutions de l’API et elle a <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/discussions/categories/interactivity-api\">sa propre catégorie</a> dans la partie Discussions du projet Gutenberg.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://beapi.fr/blog/linteractivite-sur-wordpress-une-nouvelle-api-pour-lediteur-de-blocs/\">L’interactivité sur WordPress: une nouvelle API pour l’éditeur de blocs</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://beapi.fr\">Agence WordPress Be API</a>.</p>\n\n    \";s:7:\"attribs\";a:1:{s:0:\"\";a:1:{s:4:\"type\";s:4:\"html\";}}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:6:\"author\";a:1:{i:0;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:46:\"\n            \n                                \";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:1:{s:27:\"http://www.w3.org/2005/Atom\";a:1:{s:4:\"name\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:15:\"Clément Boirie\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}}s:6:\"source\";a:1:{i:0;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:67:\"\n                    \n                            \n                \";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:1:{s:27:\"http://www.w3.org/2005/Atom\";a:2:{s:2:\"id\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:48:\"https://beapi.fr/blog/categories/wordpress/feed/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:5:\"BeAPI\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}}}}}i:5;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:70:\"\n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n            \n                \n    \";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:1:{s:27:\"http://www.w3.org/2005/Atom\";a:9:{s:2:\"id\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:60:\"https://wp-rocket.me/fr/blog/wp-rocket-3-15/#comment-4387875\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:116:\"Commentaires sur 3.15 – Le LazyLoad désormais disponible pour les images de backgrounds CSS par Valentina Orlandi\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:1:{s:0:\"\";a:1:{s:4:\"type\";s:4:\"html\";}}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:0:\"\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:1:{s:0:\"\";a:2:{s:4:\"href\";s:60:\"https://wp-rocket.me/fr/blog/wp-rocket-3-15/#comment-4387875\";s:3:\"rel\";s:9:\"alternate\";}}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"updated\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"2023-09-21T11:19:37.000+02:00\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:9:\"published\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"2023-09-21T11:19:37.000+02:00\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"summary\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:564:\"En réponse à Gérard.\n\nBonjour Gérard, Pouvez-vous ouvrir un ticket de support et nous fournir les informations suivantes?\n- Liens vers les pages où vous avez remarqué le changement de score uniquement à cause de l&#039;activation de la fonctionnalité.\n- La version de la page affectée par le changement de score (Desktop ou Mobile, ou les deux ?)\nLe support aura besoin d&#039;un accès administrateur à votre site pour effectuer des tests avec et sans la nouvelle fonctionnalité.

I did it again for WP 6.3, so we can have an eye on the relative « influence » of countries and companies on WordPress Core.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Before diving into WordPress 6.3 Core contributions stats, I wanted to share a few disclaimers, for better context:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>These stats were generated after the last Release Candidate of WP 6.3. Thanks to&nbsp;<a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/desrosj/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Jon</a>&nbsp;who collected the props list for the release squad.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>These statistics only relate to Core contributions (= props gained for source code contributions) of WordPress. There is a lot of other types of contributions, not listed here: marketing, communication, translation, testing…</li>\n\n\n\n<li>To get these stats, I parsed the WordPress.org profile page of each contributor to get some public informations about them: country, employer, and wether they already contributed to WordPress Core or not.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>It includes both Core contributions on Trac and Gutenberg pull requests on GitHub.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Those stats are based on what’s declared in each contributors’s wp.org profile.&nbsp;<strong>Users with empty profile info are not taken into account.</strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-group alignwide is-layout-constrained wp-block-group-is-layout-constrained\"><div class=\"wp-block-group__inner-container\">\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading alignwide\">WordPress 6.3 overall stats</h2>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-columns alignwide is-layout-flex wp-container-5 wp-block-columns-is-layout-flex\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-column is-vertically-aligned-center is-layout-flow wp-block-column-is-layout-flow\" style=\"flex-basis:33.33%\">\n<p><strong>About 640</strong>&nbsp;<strong>people</strong>&nbsp;from at least&nbsp;<strong>52 countries</strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong>186 identified companies</strong>&nbsp;contributed to WordPress&nbsp;6.3.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Worth noting that&nbsp;<strong>207 people contributed to WordPress Core for the very first time!</strong>&nbsp;That’s&nbsp;about&nbsp;<strong>32%</strong>&nbsp;of the total number of contributors!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The ratio of new contributors is still quite good for an open-source project!<a href=\"https://jeanbaptisteaudras.com/2019/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/evolution-release-wp62.svg\"></a></p>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-column is-vertically-aligned-center is-layout-flow wp-block-column-is-layout-flow\" style=\"flex-basis:66.66%\">\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img width=\"831\" height=\"523\" src=\"https://jeanbaptisteaudras.com/2019/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Evolution-of-WordPress-Core-contributors-across-recent-releases-2.svg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-145060\" //></figure>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div></div>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading alignwide\">Country ranking by number of contributions</h2>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-columns alignwide is-layout-flex wp-container-9 wp-block-columns-is-layout-flex\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-column is-layout-flow wp-block-column-is-layout-flow\" style=\"flex-basis:33.33%\">\n<p>It’s interesting to see how much WordPress is a worldwide project.

Le bloc Espacement a également été refondu pour intégrer de nouveaux contrôles de hauteur.</p>\n</div><figure class=\"wp-block-media-text__media\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1080\" height=\"622\" src=\"https://www.whodunit.fr/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/spacing-presets-1080x622.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-75959 size-full\" //></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress 6.3 intègre une cinquantaine d&#8217;améliorations de l’accessibilité du CMS, notamment des améliorations du formulaire de connexion et des étapes d&#8217;installation, et de la navigation dans l&#8217;éditeur de site. Les contrôles d’édition d&#8217;images ont été revus complètement et l&#8217;amélioration du tri et de la sélection des tableaux de listes contribuent à rendre WP encore plus accessible.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-media-text alignwide is-stacked-on-mobile\" data-block-type=\"core\"><figure class=\"wp-block-media-text__media\"><video controls src=\"https://www.whodunit.fr/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/249687731-48c96ad2-452b-4bcf-a05f-0a1afd0b2ce5.mp4\"></video></figure><div class=\"wp-block-media-text__content\">\n<p>Changement de nom pour les blocs réutilisables&nbsp;!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>En effet, les blocs réutilisables seront maintenant nommés “compositions synchronisées” (synced patterns) et seront accessibles dans la même interface que les autres compositions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Il suffira de cliquer sur un bouton pour indiquer que le contenu d’une composition sera synchronisée à l’échelle de tout le site&nbsp;!</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-small-font-size\">Ci-contre, la gestion des compositions synchronisées (<span lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\" class=\"lang-attribute\">reusable blocks</span>) et des compositions non synchronisées (<span lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\" class=\"lang-attribute\">patterns</span>) sur WordPress 6.3 beta 2.</p>\n</div></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Les outils de conception ont également été améliorés, avec l&#8217;ajout d&#8217;une gestion simplifiée des polices et de nouvelles fonctionnalités CSS pour les variations de style. Vous pourrez personnaliser vos designs avec encore plus de flexibilité et de contrôle.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Pour finir, un autre changement très attendu&nbsp;: WordPress 6.3 inclut une fonctionnalité de rollback automatique pour les mises à jour échouées des thèmes et des extensions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Quelques évolutions initialement prévues ont cependant été repoussées à WP 6.4&nbsp;: l’API de gestion des interactions, l’API de gestion des polices, le bloc Table des matières ou encore le bloc de fenêtre modale (en “ligthbox”). On patientera un peu&#8230;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Vous souhaitez en savoir plus sur les différentes améliorations et évolutions à venir dans WordPress 6.3 ?
